A. Required Introductory Material: General Introduction to the Program
1.

Specify the degree(s) offered for which accreditation is being sought.
Bachelor’s Degree

2.

Describe the institution.
Table of Contents

a.​ Describe the organizational structure, whether state or private, age of institution, brief
history, and so on.
Response: Stevenson University is a private, independent, coeducational, liberal arts university
with approximately 4,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The university was formerly
known as Villa Julie College, which was founded in 1947 as a two-year preparatory school for
women. Villa Julie became co-educational in 1972 and a four-year college in 1984. In 2004 the
first residential facilities were opened on the Owings Mills campus and in 2008 the college
changed its name to Stevenson University.
Stevenson is located in Baltimore County, Maryland. Stevenson was initially established on the
Greenspring campus but purchased the Owings Mills campus in 2002, and all recent
development has happened in that area. All human services courses are offered on the Owings
Mills campus, where the department moved in 2018. The Owings Mills campus houses all
residential facilities and most athletic and student activity facilities. The Owings Mills North
area was created by the purchase and renovation of the former Shire Pharmaceuticals site and
houses the graphic design and art facilities, as well as the Manning Academic Center. A new
library was constructed on the North Campus and opened in 2024. Offices for the Counseling
& Human Services program are in this building. CHS classes are taught in the MAC. A new
theatre is also under construction on the North Campus. The Greenspring campus no longer has
any undergraduate academic programs, although the PsyD program and administrative offices
are still located there.

b.​ Describe the institutional context of the Program. For example, include organization charts
and structure, goals, and objectives. What levels of degree are offered by the institution? For
large programs with multiple sites, organizational charts are extremely helpful to the
readers.
Table of Contents

Response: The academic structure of the University includes seven schools. Stevenson
University Online administers all graduate programs (master’s level; M.S. degree) and online
instruction targeted to adult learners. Undergraduate programs (bachelor’s level; B.S and B.A.
degrees) are organized under the Beverly K. Fine School of the Sciences, Brown School of
Business and Leadership, Sandra R. Berman School of Nursing and Health Professions, School
of Design, School of Education, and School of Humanities and Social Sciences. The
Counseling & Human Services Department is in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences
(HaSS). There are 7 departments in HaSS: Psychology, Legal Studies, Criminal Justice,
Interdisciplinary Studies, History and Humanities (the department includes philosophy and
religion courses), English Language and Literature, and Counseling & Human Services.
Organizational charts for the University and for Academic Affairs are located in the Appendix.
The University embraces the motto, “Imagine your future. Design your career” and the four
core values of community, learning, integrity and excellence. See the University Mission,
Vision & Values.

a.​ Briefly describe the strengths of the Program and any attributes that make the Program
unique.
Response: The Counseling & Human Services Program at Stevenson University is
characterized by an emphasis on field experience to develop effective human service
professionals. All Counseling & Human Services majors spend a minimum of 450 hours in
field experiences. Students are placed in agencies related to their specific interests, such as
mental health facilities, hospitals, addiction treatment centers, schools and centers for children
with developmental and behavioral problems, facilities for the elderly, government agencies,
and a variety of other sites. These valuable experiences give students the opportunity to apply
the knowledge they have gained in the program and to develop their skills as confident and
competent human services professionals.
Additional strengths of the program are:
●​ The knowledgeable and dedicated faculty, both the three full-time instructors and the
numerous adjunct instructors, who all bring significant expertise to the classroom and
work collaboratively to strengthen the program.
●​ A diverse student population who are from a wide variety of backgrounds, but are all
committed to helping others. (See pictures of recent graduating classes.)
●​ A supportive and engaged Advisory Board who understands both our students’ needs
and the demands of the human services profession. They are effective advocates for our
program, our students, and Stevenson University.
●​ A comprehensive and meaningful evaluation process that collects and analyzes
information on student performance, both in the classroom and in the field, and uses
that information to examine program processes and curriculum.
b.​ Describe institutional course requirements for all students and explain how they prepare
students for study in the human services program. For example, describe general education
or liberal arts requirements of the institution.
Response: The University requires students to take a general education core that includes two
courses in writing/literature (plus two additional writing intensive (WI) courses, one at the 200
level and one at the 300 level; this requirement is fulfilled by required courses in the program),
one communication course (usually public speaking), three courses in mathematics and science
(statistics is required and biology is recommended), one course in fine arts, and four courses in
the humanities (history, literature, religion, foreign language and philosophy). The general
education core courses prepare students to communicate effectively, think deeply and critically
about problems, and understand the complex social and cultural context of issues. A solid base
in the liberal arts allows students to better understand the problems and perspectives of their
clients and to be more effective helpers. See University learning goals.

c.​ Include any other background information that may be pertinent such as action plans for
identified problem areas, changing enrollment patterns, marketing strategies, or institutional
or curricular restructuring.
Response: Enrollment in the Counseling & Human Services Program declined over the past ten
years, but over the past 5 years has been relatively stable with about 50 majors. The program is
well-established and continues to fulfill an important role in the University. Marketing
strategies are centralized in the admissions area of the university, but a departmental Instagram
page has been established and a centrally located bulletin board for the department highlights
activities and graduates. There has been significant expansion university-wide with the addition
of athletic fields on the East Campus and a new academic hub library where CHS offices are
located. The CHS Program Coordinator, John Rosicky, developed a network of trails in the
wooded areas between campuses. Programmatically, we have reduced the number of required
credits in the CHS program (see program changes in 4c below) to further improve the flexibility
of the program and make it more enticing as a transfer destination. The final practicum is still 9
credit hours, but the number of hours has been reduced to 360 hours to alleviate student stress.
With the 90 hour internship we still exceed the required number of experience hours for the
program.
4.

Interim Report and Review and Reaccreditations only
Table of Contents
a.​ Include a copy of the letter from the Vice President of Accreditation (VPA) sent at the time
of the prior accreditation notifying the Program of the disposition of the application for
accreditation.
Response: The Human Services Program was initially granted accreditation by CSHSE in
October of 2004. It was granted reaccreditation based on a self-study in October of 2009, with a
full site visit in 2014, and again based on a self-study in 2019.
See reaccreditation letter in the Appendix.

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

b.​ Describe how each condition in the VPA letter has been addressed.
Response: The four requirements for the current reaccreditation were all addressed. More
details are given under the appropriate Specifications, but briefly the requirements were:
●​ Standard 11.c Historical and current legislation affecting service delivery
Include more emphasis on social policy, both present issues as well as how legislation has
shaped existing services (or lack of).
-​ The title of the introductory course for the program CHS 201 was changed from
“Introduction to Human Services” to “Human Services and Social Policy” in 2018 along
with the addition of additional emphasis on social policy issues (see current syllabus)
●​ Standard 12.g Processes to effect social change through advocacy work at all levels of
society including community development, community and grass-roots organizing, and
local and global activism
Include advocacy and social change for marginalized populations. Such advocacy can occur in
the context of a human service agency but also by assisting and empowering individuals and
community groups/organizations/churches to effectively advocate for resources and services
that address their needs and concerns.
-​ In addition to the changes to CHS 201 mentioned about, an assignment was added to that
course on conducting an assessment of community needs and proposing steps to address
those needs, including advocacy and community organizing (not just doing “for”). This
introduction is more thoroughly expanded in CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, in
which students write a grant proposal to address community needs with a fully developed
rationale for the proposed strategy.
●​ Standard 14.g Knowledge, theory, and skills are included, analyzed, and applied in the
curriculum in regard to: performing and elementary community needs assessment:
Include a greater emphasis in the program on community development in contrast to the strong
emphasis on service delivery within human services agencies.
-​ As mentioned above, a major assignment in the introductory course was added requiring
students to visit a community/agency, assess needs, and report on ways to strength that
community.
●​ Standard 14.h Knowledge, theory, and skills are included, analyzed, and applied in the
curriculum in regard to conducting a basic program evaluation:
Include more direct instruction on designing and conducting a program evaluation and on
understanding research, in order to effectively identify, understand, and utilize evidence based
practices.
-​ This issue is covered thoroughly in CHS 340 Administration of Human Services and in
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing. Conducting a program evaluation is part of
strategic program planning and evaluation, as well as evidence-based management, both of
which are units in the administration course. In addition, the narratives of program
proposals developed in the research methods course must contain detailed plans for
program evaluation.

c.​ Describe any major program changes since the prior accreditation.
Response: The program is fundamentally the same and the purpose, mission and objectives
have not changed. The curriculum has been modified slightly as described below. The Sheppard
Pratt certificate (a 5-course sequence of CHS courses offered to SP employees at their campus)
has been on hold since the fourth cohort graduated in December of 2021. Detailed program
analyses were conducted at faculty retreats in 2021 and 2022. One of our fulltime faculty
members, Tom Swisher, retired in December of 2022 and the decrease from 4 to 3 faculty
members resulted in the “department” becoming a “program”.

d.​ Describe any major curriculum changes since the prior accreditation.
Response:
Summary of Changes to the Counseling & Human Services Program:
●​ The course number of Human Services and Social Policy (introductory course in the
first semester of the program) was changed from CHS 201 to CHS 105 in 2020.
●​ Social Justice was added as a topic for CHS 250 Topics in Human Services. (2021)
The following changes were all implemented in 2023 following a departmental retreat in
December of 2022.
●​ CHS 270 Psychopharmacology and Addictions will no longer be required of all
students, but is still required in the Addictions and Mental Health Track and is a
recommended elective course.
●​ CHS 217 Professional Development in Counseling & Human Services will be replaced
by CA 205 Foundations of Career offered by the Career Services Office
●​ Two CHS electives are still required, but the “Focused Elective” category has been
eliminated, reducing the total number of required credits by 9 credits. (We used to
require 5 Focused Electives, including at least 2 CHS courses).
●​ The number of hours for the CHS 440 Practicum in Human Services has been reduced
from 410 to 360. The course is still 9 credit hours and fully meets accreditation
requirements.
●​ Changes result in a decrease in total program requirements from 72 credits to 58 credits.
Student still need a total of 120 credits to earn a B.S. The remaining requirements are
general education courses and electives.
5.

If the Program is delivered at multiple sites:
Table of Contents
a.​ For each site:
●​ Describe the physical location and any unique characteristics.
●​ Identify the faculty, directors, and staff.
●​ Describe the student population.
Response: Although Stevenson’s physical facilities are split across two campuses, they are
integrated into one University, so the Counseling & Human Services Program is not delivered
at multiple sites. Departmental offices and all CHS courses are located on the Owings Mills
campus.
b.​ Furnish evidence of formal policies and procedures that assure continuity and quality
control of Program and Curriculum across all sites.
Response: Not applicable.

I. GENERAL PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS
A. Institutional Requirements and Primary Program Objective
Context: There is strong national commitment to the view that human services programs should
develop professionals who provide direct or indirect services. These programs prepare human services
professionals for a variety of functions related to the care and treatment of individuals, families,
groups, and communities.
Standard 1: The primary program objective shall be to prepare human services professionals to
serve individuals, families, groups, communities and/or other supported human services
organization functions.
Table of Contents
Specifications for Standard 1
a.

The program is part of a degree granting college or university that is regionally accredited.
Response: Stevenson University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher
Education.

b.

Provide evidence that the development of competent human services professionals is the
primary objective of the program and the basis for the degree program title, design, goals and
curriculum, teaching methodology, and program administration (e.g. through documents such as
catalog, brochures, course syllabi, website, and marketing materials).
Response:
The Counseling & Human Services Program is designed for students who want to provide
human services for people in need. The major prepares students for careers in human services
and also for graduate school. The courses provide students with a comprehensive understanding
of how individuals and families develop and function. Students also acquire the skills necessary
to provide services to individuals and families. The Counseling & Human Services Program
goals are designed to prepare students for productive and meaningful work in the human
services field. Graduates are expected to “apply key concepts, methods and values in human
services to professional situations,” as stated in the program purpose and objectives.
The program objectives are focused on preparing our majors for productive and meaningful
experiences in the human services field. Graduates are expected to apply meaningful
connections between classroom learning and experience in the field, demonstrate a professional
attitude with sensitivity to diversity, display appropriate interpersonal skills and professional
behavior, and exhibit their own continuing self-development (See Program Goals).
The program’s focus on developing competent human service professionals is reflected in all
departmental materials, including the Stevenson Catalog (See the Counseling & Human
Services Program under Fields of Study), departmental brochure, and the department website.
See also course descriptions and syllabi for all CHS courses.

c.

Articulate how students are informed of the curricular and program expectations and
requirements prior to admission.
Table of Contents
Response: Prospective students and their parents or guardians may attend one of five “Open
Houses” offered by Stevenson University. During each Open House, faculty and current students
from the Counseling & Human Services Department provide a classroom session in which the
program structure, goals and expectations are reviewed, with opportunities for questions and
discussion. In addition, the Department Chair meets every year with the university recruiters in
the Admissions Office to provide them with updated information about the Counseling &
Human Services Program so they can speak knowledgably about it to potential students.
Current students who are not Counseling & Human Service majors, as well as prospective
students, can access information about the program in numerous ways, including the program
website, individual interviews with faculty, information displayed near the program office, and
at numerous activities and functions offered throughout the year by the Human Services Club.
Many non-majors also take CHS 101 Family Studies or CHS 105 Human Services and Social
Policy to meet the social science requirement and are thereby introduced to the field of human
services.
All students who enter the major, either by transferring from another major or another school, or
by starting at Stevenson, are informed of all aspects of the curricular and program requirements
and expectations in the following ways: Transfer students meet individually with the
Department Chair, who explains all program requirements, provides a student handbook, and
creates an individualized plan of study. New college students participate in a group orientation
before they enter the program where they receive a student handbook and get help with
establishing a plan of study and registering for classes. They also participate in the 1-credit
course FYS 100 First Year Seminar, which has a designated section for Counseling & Human
Services majors.

d.

Provide a brief history of the program.
Table of Contents
Response: The Family Studies Program was developed by Dr. Gigi Franyo in 1999 and began
accepting students in Fall 2000. Dr. Franyo was the program coordinator and only full-time
faculty member until 2004. The name of the program was changed to Family and Community
Services in Spring 2003. Beginning in Fall 2004, the program acquired one additional full-time
faculty member, Dr. Tom Swisher, to teach courses and serve as the field placement coordinator.
The program was awarded accreditation from CSHSE in October of 2004. It expanded to three
full-time faculty members in 2005, when Ms. Lauri Weiner joined the faculty. The name of the
program was changed to Human Services in 2007 and in 2009 the Human Services Program was
reaccredited by CSHSE. In 2012, the Program became a Department when Dr. John Rosicky
was hired as Department Chair. In the fall of 2014, Dr. Mayaugust Finkenberg joined the
full-time faculty when Dr. Franyo began phased retirement. In 2018, the department and
program name was changed to Counseling & Human Services in order to be more easily
recognizable and help with recruiting. In December of 2022, Tom Swisher retired from the
department; this resulted in the “department” designation being changed to “program”.
Department offices moved from the Manning Academic Center (MAC) on the Owings Mills
North campus to the new PAZ library building in January of 2024; all CHS classes are still
offered in MAC.

e.

Describe the student population including the number, gender, and diversity of students, as well
as the numbers of full time, part time, and students graduating each year.
Response: Fall 2023 enrollment figures show 56 Counseling & Human Services majors. The
vast majority are full-time students (96%). Majors are predominantly female (87%) with an
average age of 22. They are from a wide variety of backgrounds, including the city of Baltimore
and surrounding suburbs and rural areas. Most students are from the Mid-Atlantic region. The
major is ethnically diverse (49% white; 45% black; 4% Hispanic; 2% Asian/other). The number
of graduates has been fairly consistent with 24 in the 2018/2019 academic year and 20 in the
2022/2023 academic year. See attached table of enrollment and graduation trends and
demographic information and pictures of recent graduating classes.

as described by Schram and Mandell in An Introduction to Human Services (2000). This model
emphasizes the importance of the following three components to becoming an effective human
services professional: Attitudes, including self-awareness and such personal attributes as
empathy, warmth and genuineness; Skills, including case management, ethical decision-making,
counseling strategies, and group leadership; and Knowledge of topics such as human
development, psychopathology, group and family dynamics, diversity of lifestyles, legal issues
that affect helping, the impact of society and culture on behavior, and the evaluation of research.
b.​ Include a mission statement for the program.
Table of Contents
Response:
The mission of the Counseling & Human Services Program is to provide students with an
educational foundation that will prepare them for meaningful and effective careers within the
human services field and successful continuation of their education.
Purpose
The Counseling & Human Services Department prepares students to become effective
professionals in the helping disciplines. The program focuses on skill development, problem
solving, and the application of research and best practice principles. Students learn to help
others and to prepare thoughtfully and systematically for their careers. To meet these
commitments, the Counseling & Human Services Department offers its students a broad
curriculum, learning experiences and professional activities beyond the classroom, and high
levels of student-faculty interaction and collaboration.
c.​ Demonstrate alignment with the mission of the units in which the program is housed (e.g.,
department, college, university, etc.).
Table of Contents
Response: The Counseling & Human Services Department is housed within the School of
Humanities and Social Sciences (HaSS), along with the following other programs: Psychology,
Criminal Justice, Interdisciplinary Studies, English Language and Literature, History, and Legal
Studies. According to the HaSS web page, the School offers students “a wide range of
possibilities, experiences, and opportunities while maintaining SU’s commitment to small
classes, personal attention, and career preparation. Our programs encourage students to learn
outside the confines of their chosen fields of study as well as outside the classroom.” Students
in the School “learn not just how to do but also why [they] do.”

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

The University is an innovative, coeducational, independent university offering undergraduate
and graduate students a career-focused education marked by individualized attention, civility,
and respect for difference. The university blends the liberal arts with career exploration and
planning, complementing a traditional education with applied learning beyond the classroom.
The university meets students where they are and supports and challenges them to become
reflective and accomplished individuals committed to a lifetime of learning and contribution.
Students graduate with the competence and confidence needed to address creatively the
opportunities and problems facing their communities, the nation, and the world.
The Counseling & Human Services Program at Stevenson utilizes an approach that is
career-focused by offering two distinct field experiences. Individualized attention is emphasized
through advising (students are required to meet with their advisors every semester.), faculty
attention to individual needs (discussed at program faculty meetings), and in the field placement
process (the Field Placement Coordinator meets individually with all prospective interns and
practicum students.). Civility and respect for differences is underscored throughout the Program
through course work. Behavioral guidelines of civility and professionalism are taught to and
assessed for all majors before and during field placements. Special needs accommodations are
available to our majors. Career exploration suited to the unique needs and interests of our
students is an integral part of CHS 380 (Internship in Counseling & Human Services), CHS 441
(Seminar in Counseling & Human Services), and the field placement process.
d.​ Provide a brief description of the major knowledge base and theories from which the curriculum
draws to support the conceptual framework (e.g. counseling theories, biopsychosocial, systems
theory, change theory, etc.).
Table of Contents
Response: The Counseling & Human Services program emphasizes the interdisciplinary,
biopsychosocial approach to helping. Throughout the program, students are introduced to
various theoretical orientations, such as psychoanalysis, behavioral and cognitive-behavioral
approaches to treatment, and client-centered therapies, but the emphasis is on an eclectic
orientation that stresses the importance of flexibility to adapt helping responses to individual
needs and circumstances.
e.​ Describe the multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, or transdisciplinary approach to knowledge,
theories, and skills included in the curriculum.
Table of Contents
Response: The Counseling & Human Services program utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to
knowledge, theories and skills that includes liberal arts courses, human services skills courses,
and field experiences. The general education core curriculum for the University includes an
emphasis on writing, literature, communication, mathematics and scientific reasoning, computer
and information literacy, and the arts and humanities. The Counseling & Human Services major
incorporates courses in psychology, sociology, psychopharmacology, research methods and
statistics. (See program curriculum)

Response: The course matrix for departmental courses is here. The matrix for non-departmental
courses is here.

C. Community Assessment
Context: Human services programs continually interact with and affect human services delivery
within the local community through field placements and alumnae/i. Programs should be designed to
interface with the needs of major employers in terms of job needs and career ladders so there is an
orderly and continuous supply of competent professionals.
Standard 3: The program shall include periodic mechanisms for assessment of and response to
changing policies, needs, and trends of the profession and community.
Specifications for Standard 3:
a.​ If the program is less than five years old, provide documentation that supported the initial
development of the human services program (such as a community needs assessment).
Table of Contents
Response: Program is more than 5 years old.
b.​ An Advisory Committee shall be established to provide feedback regarding local, state, and
national trends and needs, policy changes, and to act as an advocate for the program. The
committee should include individuals representing the human services field, such as field
experience agencies, employing agencies, citizen advocacy groups, alumnae/i, current students,
adjunct faculty, and other persons related to the field of human services. Provide the following:
1.​ A detailed description of the membership of the Advisory Committee (e.g. names, agencies,
roles, relationship to program, etc.),
Response: There are currently 14 external members of the Advisory Board, in addition to the 3
full-time faculty members in the department. The external members represent field placement
agencies, employing agencies, graduate programs, community college human services program,
adjunct faculty, and alumni. Note that the member from CCBC is also deeply involved in
addiction credentialing in the state of Maryland and provides expertise in the area of addiction
counseling, as well as teaching our addiction-related courses. See attached roster of Advisory
Board members.
2.​ Minutes of advisory committee meetings from the last two years
Response: The Advisory Board meets twice a year, typically in September and February.
Minutes from the last four meetings (2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years) are here.
3.​ A narrative or table of how the committee interfaces with the program in relationship to
specific issues.

Response: As illustrated in the Advisory Board minutes, the Board regularly provides helpful
suggestions on such program issues as recruitment, curriculum needs (such as the recently
approved professional writing course), the development of graduate programs, and
internship/practicum requirements (such as the need for paid field experiences). At every
meeting, program enrollment and completion statistics are presented, along with a summary of
internship and practicum placements and the activities of the Human Services Club. During fall
meetings, the annual report, including student feedback, is reviewed with the Board.
Suggestions and comments are encouraged both during and after the meeting.
c.​ Describe other mechanisms, if any, used to respond to changing needs in the human services
field.
Table of Contents
Response: Feedback is solicited from both field experience site supervisors and university
supervisors (practicum only) who work with students in their internship and practicum
placements. The department gets specific feedback on the performance of students and these
supervisors may suggest areas where students, or the program, could improve. Students also
provide feedback on the program before they graduate. All of this information is reviewed by
department faculty and used to plan for program modifications. Formal department meetings
occur every month and include both full-time and part-time instructors.
D. Program Evaluation
Context: To ensure the program is effective in producing competent professionals, the program must
be evaluated on a regular basis. In addition, the program must assess how well the needs of students
and graduates are being met. These evaluations/ assessments are the bases for modifying and
improving the program.
Standard 4: The program shall conduct, and report to the public, consistent formal evaluations,
which determine its effectiveness in meeting the needs of the students, community, and the
human services field.
Specifications for Standard 4:
a.

The program has clear, measureable student learning outcomes that align with the standards and
an assessment plan that has been implemented. Provide the following:

2.​ Assessment plan
Response:
The Assessment Plan for measuring the above student learning outcomes utilizes the evaluation
of student performance in their field placements during their final semester in the program to
determine whether students have met the learning objectives. Each of the program goals and
learning objectives are incorporated into this evaluation tool. Students are rated during their
internship using this evaluation and they are rated at the midpoint of their final practicum
experience, so they have an opportunity to improve on any objectives on which they are below
expectations.
Measures and Timing
Evaluation is a critical part of the Counseling & Human Services Department. The needs of our
communities, both our external community (agencies) and our internal community (students),
are evaluated extensively and frequently through both quantitative and qualitative measures.
QUANTITATIVE MEASURES. Quantitative measures and the timing for each are as follows:
​
a. Agency Evaluation by Student – At end of field placement
​
b. Course Evaluation by Student – At conclusion of fall and spring semester courses
​
c. Field Placement Prerequisites Checklist – Prior to fall and spring field placements
d. Graduate Acceptance by Graduate Programs – Annually at conclusion of spring
semester
​
e. Graduate Evaluation by Employer – Every five years (1 year after graduation)
​
f. Program Evaluation by Senior – Immediately after completion of program
​
g. Program Evaluation by Graduate – Annually (1 year after graduation)
​
h. Program Evaluation/Student Field Placement Evaluation by Student and Field
Instructor – At midpoint and end of field placement
i. Student Assessment by Faculty (Behavioral Indicators) – Commencing when student
joins major.
j. University Faculty Supervisor Evaluation by Student – At end of field placement.
​
QUALITATIVE INFORMATION. Qualitative information and the timing for each are as
follows:
a. Advisory Board Meetings - One meeting per semester plus unscheduled
communication
b. Faculty Evaluation by Department Chair – Course syllabi and objectives are reviewed
every semester. Faculty members are observed regularly, following the University
guidelines. Faculty Professional Development Plans are reviewed and discussed with
faculty members during the annual Performance Appraisal Meeting.

c. Faculty Meetings - One meeting per month plus unscheduled communication
d. Focus Groups of Graduates – At completion of program
e. Midterm Faculty Evaluation by Student – At midpoint of fall and spring semester
courses
f. Program Evaluation by Student (Focus Group) – At completion of program
g. Responses to additional open-ended questions on all quantitative measures listed
above – Timing varies as shown above.

​

The field placement evaluation is the primary measure for student learning outcomes. However,
additional measures for some of the outcomes occur in other courses. Goal 1, which involves the
use of research literature to analyze problems in human services and the importance of ethics in
social research, is assessed during CHS 224 Introduction to Research. Goal 4, regarding
culturally sensitive behavior, is partially assessed during CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural
Competence. Both of these goals are also assessed in the final field placement evaluation, but
specific assignments and evaluations during these courses provide additional evidence of
student achievement.
3.​ Examples of assessment tools, e.g., rubrics, exams, portfolios, surveys, capstone evaluations,
etc.
Response: The field placement evaluation tool is presented in the Appendix. Students rate
themselves at both the midpoint and end of their field experience (the same evaluation is used
for both the internship and practicum, so students are familiar with the items). They are then
rated by their site supervisor, who discusses the ratings with the student. For each of the six
major learning goals and associated objectives, students are rated as being below expectations,
meeting expectations, or exceeding expectations. These ratings are reviewed by the University
Supervisor and used as both an evaluation of the student’s course performance and as a learning
tool for students to improve their performance.
4.​ A description of how the evaluation may or may not have resulted in any change.
Response: One important result of recent program evaluations was the modification of the
writing course that was created in 2014 to address an identified need to help students strengthen
writing skills. That need still exists, but the writing requirements have been distributed between
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, the newly created CHS 217 Professional
Development in Counseling & Human Services, and CHS 360 Counseling Strategies for
Individuals which incorporates the writing of case notes, incident reports and treatment plans.
Students have consistently requested more variety in focused elective offerings. Elective courses
have been expanded to include Trauma and Crisis Intervention, Therapeutic Recreation,
Disability Studies, Coping, and Resilience and Growth Focused Counseling, in addition to
regular offerings. See the schedule of elective offerings.
Students frequently mentioned that the textbook for the seminar would have been helpful during
the internship. As a result of these suggestions, the textbook (Successful Internship by Sweitzer
and King) is now introduced in the internship and several chapters are used in that course.
Students frequently comment on the challenging time demands of the practicum and the stress
and exhaustion that they feel. Partly as a result of this feedback, the 12-credit (540 hour) option
for the practicum is being eliminated for students entering the program. The practicum will be
9-credits and 410 hours for all students going forward.

b.

The program shall conduct a formal program evaluation every five years. The formal evaluation
shall include: student surveys, agency surveys, graduate follow-up surveys (directed to both
graduates and their employers), active participation of the advisory committee, involvement of
agencies where students are in field placements, course and faculty evaluations, and evaluative
data mandated or conducted by the institution. Provide the following:
Table of Contents
1.​ A history of program evaluations
Response: Comprehensive program evaluations that include the results of faculty and course
evaluations, agency surveys, graduate surveys, and student surveys, as well as the active
participation of the Advisory Board, have occurred annually since 2005. Employer evaluations
of graduates occur regularly. These evaluations are supplemented by self-studies completed
every five years for Council reaccreditation. Here is the Program Evaluation for 2018-2019.
2.​ A description of the methodology
Response:
Both quantitative and qualitative measures are employed to evaluate the Program. See the
Program Evaluation Plan and copies of evaluation tools in the appendix. Evaluation tools that
focus on faculty members are described in Standard 8.
Students complete quantitative evaluations of various facets of the Program, including
evaluations of instructors (at midterm and end of each course), courses (at midterm and end of
each course), field placement agencies (at midterm and end of field placement), University
supervisors, agency supervisors, and, upon their completion of the Program and annually (one
year after graduation), students evaluate the Program itself. Other quantitative evaluations are
completed of graduate acceptance by graduate programs and by employers of Program
graduates.
Qualitative evaluations of field placement agencies utilized by the Program are made by
University Supervisors in written submissions to the Field Placement Coordinator (at midterm
and end of field placement) and by the Field Placement Coordinator in semester and annual
assessments and revisions of what agencies are appropriate for field placements. In addition,
qualitative evaluations are conducted each semester and in unscheduled communication by
Program Advisory Board members. The Department Chair conducts qualitative evaluations of
faculty, as more fully explained in the narrative for Standard 8, through a combination of review
of syllabi and course objectives, classroom observations, and annual performance appraisals.
Other qualitative evaluations occur by faculty at monthly faculty meetings, by seniors in focus
groups at the completion of the Program, and in response to open ended questions on
quantitative measures.
The Program Evaluation is disseminated by the Department Chair to faculty members, Advisory
Board members, and the Field Placement Coordinator. The recipients then provide their input
and recommendations regarding the Program Evaluation and the Program itself. See response to
Standard 4c1 below for more details about dissemination of evaluation results.
3.​ A summative analysis of the most recent evaluation
Response:
The most recently completed formal program evaluation was for the 2018-2019 academic year.
(See the full report here.) In summary, the results confirm that the present curriculum and field

​

experiences are effective in meeting the program mission, “to provide students with an
educational foundation that will prepare them for meaningful and effective careers within the
human services field and successful continuation of their education.” Student field placement
evaluations also indicate that the program goals are being met.
Students praised their CHS courses and the Counseling & Human Services faculty. Some
suggestions related to the Counseling & Human Services curriculum included an expansion of
topics course offerings and tracks to include such areas as: child life, disabilities and special
education, counseling for children and youth, and school counseling.
Several students questioned the usefulness of some of the general education courses and other
non-departmental courses.
4.​ A description of how and in what way the evaluation resulted in any change.
Response:
One important result of recent program evaluations was the reduction in the required hours for
the practicum from 410 hours to 360 hours. There had been a number of comments about the
stresses and mental health effects of the practicum. While learning to create a healthy work-life
balance is part of professional growth, that can still be achieved in a slightly less demanding
schedule.
Students have consistently requested more variety in focused elective offerings. Elective courses
have been expanded to include Trauma and Crisis Intervention, Social Justice, Disability
Studies, Coping, and Resilience and Growth Focused Counseling, in addition to regular
offerings. See the attached schedule of elective offerings.
Students frequently mentioned that the textbook for the seminar would have been helpful during
the internship. As a result of these suggestions, the textbook (Successful Internship by Sweitzer
and King) is now introduced in the internship and several chapters are used in that course.
c.

The program must routinely provide reliable information to the public on its performance,
including student achievement. [NOTE: This Specification relates to accreditation standards or
policies that require institutions or programs routinely to provide reliable information to the

E. Policies and Procedures for Admitting, Retaining, and Dismissing Students
Context: Students have a right to know, prior to enrollment, the standards of the human services
program and the procedures for admitting, retaining, and dismissing students. Both academic and
behavioral issues need to be considered.
Standard 5: The program shall have written standards and procedures for admitting, retaining,
and dismissing students.
Specifications for Standard 5:
a.

Provide documentation of policies regarding the selection and admission of students.
Table of Contents
Response:
Students enter the program in accordance with the University's admission policies and
procedures. See the Admissions section of the University Catalog online. There are no
additional requirements for the Program. Students are able to enter the program at the
beginning of their first year or at any point throughout their college career; however, all
requirements for the program must be completed prior to graduation.

b.

Provide documentation of policies and procedures for referring students for individualized
personal and academic assistance. These policies must be consistent with the institution’s
policies.
Table of Contents
Response:
As a relatively small program, students are well known to departmental faculty and the support
and ultimate success of every student is a priority. Each student is assigned a faculty advisor,
and concerns (as well as plans to address them) about any students by any faculty members are
discussed at every Department faculty meeting. Concerns about any issues, either academic or
personal, are referred to the Office of Student Success, either through direct contact with staff in
that office or through an Early Alert notification. The Office of Student Success follows up on
all concerns and makes appropriate referrals as needed, keeping faculty members informed
throughout the process. In addition, the University has a Wellness Center which offers a
personalized environment, addressing an individual's needs through health and counseling
services. While no referral form is used, faculty provide information about the Wellness Center
to students who may need this resource and make contact with the Director of the Wellness
Center about students referred. For more information about this service, visit the website

Several University initiatives that potentially affect the wellness and support of students in the
Counseling & Human Services Program include the existence of a Director of Multicultural
Affairs, the University's written statement on accommodations, the Academic Link, and the
Office of Student Success, as described in the following:
Director of Multicultural Affairs. This position was first filled in July 2003. The Director
of Multicultural Affairs coordinates the College's efforts to foster a diverse learning and
working environment. The Director provides counsel in initiating, developing, and
implementing short and long-range plans related to diversity efforts. He or she develops
and maintains collaborative relationships with students, faculty, staff, community groups,
and professional organizations while developing and implementing diversity and
multi-cultural programs. The University also promotes multi-cultural events and speakers,
including “Multi-Cultural Week.”
University accommodations for students with disabilities. The Program adheres to the
University policy on disability. A disabled student is referred to the University’s Office of
Student Success if he or she is not currently involved with them. Faculty in the Program
work with Student Success Services to make sure the student has the accommodations
needed to be successful in the program. Policy and procedures regarding students with
disabilities are outlined online here.
The Academic Link. Students work together with tutors as a team to learn effective study
strategies, increase understanding of course content, and become independent learners. Any
University student is eligible for free tutoring or other academic assistance in most subjects.
More information about The Academic Link is available online.
The Center for Student Success. The Center for Student Success provides services and
resources to students, faculty and staff that will strengthen academic performance, enhance
student satisfaction, and improve student retention. For a complete description of the
numerous services provided by this office, visit the website.

c.

Provide documentation of written policies and procedures describing the due process for
probation, dismissal, appeal, and grievance procedures affecting students.
Table of Contents
Response:
The Counseling & Human Services Program follows the University’s policies and procedures
related to due process for probation, dismissal, appeal, and grievance procedures. Redress of
student grievances and the policies and procedures regarding disciplinary proceedings can be
found in the Stevenson University Policy Manual, Vol. V: Student Policies. Procedures for due
process and appeal of all decisions are clearly laid out in this document, which is available to
students on the SU portal and is included here on the thumb drive.

d.

Provide documentation of program policies and procedures for assessing and managing student
attributes, characteristics, and behaviors (“fitness for the profession”) that are important for the
success of human service professionals.

Table of Contents
Response: The Program’s behavioral expectations are included in the Counseling & Human
Services Student Handbook. Ethical behavior is addressed in the section on Department
Procedures and in Appendix F, which lists the “Ethical Standards of Human Service
Professionals.” A copy of the Handbook is provided to all Counseling & Human Services
majors when they enter the major and they sign a New Student Acknowledgement Form
confirming that they have received a handbook and agree to abide by the ethical standards.
Faculty members who have a concern related to a student’s behavior document the concern with
specific behaviors and discuss their concern with the individual student. The student's advisor is
also notified. A list of “behavioral indicators” addressing respect for others, interpersonal skills,
and professionalism is provided in the Counseling & Human Services Student Handbook here.
In addition to their presence in the Handbook, the Behavioral Indicators are reviewed when
students enter the major and in both the Professional Development course (CHS 217) and
Internship course (CHS 380).
Time is set aside at every faculty meeting for faculty members to raise any concerns they may
have about students, including behavioral or legal concerns. A plan on whether or how to
address concerns is discussed and documented. Common initial outcomes include discussion of
the concern between the instructor and student, referral of the student to his or her advisor,
referral of the student to the Program Coordinator, referral of the student to the Stevenson
Wellness Center, and/or referral of the student to another appropriate resource (see Department
Meeting Minutes).
Satisfactory performance in CHS 380 (internship and accompanying seminar) is required for the
practicum (CHS 440). Unsatisfactory performance (a grade below C) in CHS 380 will result in
ineligibility for CHS 440. Students whose performance in CHS 380 is unsatisfactory are
permitted to repeat the course. A second grade below C in CHS 380 will result in dismissal
from the program (See CHS Student Handbook here).
Students who have prior legal problems are not denied admission to the major; however, some
field placements sites will not accept students who have a criminal record. Students are advised
that they may need to submit to criminal background checks at internship or practicum sites.
Prior to assignment of potential field placements, students complete a survey form asking that
they explain any issues or limitations that could impact their field placement (such as disability,
criminal record, citizenship) (See Appendix 5, pp. 2, 3.). Agencies that require a personal
background check make the arrangements for doing so with the student. Procedures for handling
issues which may arise during the field placement experience are addressed in the Field
Placement Handbook here and here in the Counseling & Human Services Student Handbook.

F. Credentials of Human Services Faculty
Context: Human services programs have relied primarily on professionals from fields such as human
services, psychology, sociology, social work, counseling, political science, adult education, and
nursing to provide teaching faculty. Since both field and classroom orientations are important
characteristics of teaching staff, consideration should be given to faculty trained in human services
and/or interdisciplinary methods and approaches.

Describe the process for faculty and staff evaluation. Documentation may come from a variety
of sources and may include, among others, student evaluations, administrative review,
comments from field placement agencies, and peer review.
Response:
Each faculty member in the Counseling & Human Services Program is evaluated annually by
the Department Chair and by themselves. In addition, faculty members are evaluated by students
at midterm and at the semester conclusion of every course.
An extensive, University-wide faculty evaluation system provides a vehicle for the
documentation of successful teaching and for the citation of areas where instructional
improvement is being undertaken. All faculty members, full-time or adjunct, are expected to be
actively documenting their performance and working to expand their competence as instructors.
The system includes three criteria, which correspond to criteria for faculty rank. They are
professional competence and scholarship, teaching effectiveness, and service to the college and
profession (not required for adjuncts).
The following table outlines the variety of resources through which the three criteria for faculty
evaluation are evaluated:

Copies of the Faculty Performance Appraisal- Department Chair Evaluation, Student
Evaluation Form, Faculty Response to Student Evaluation Data, Classroom Observation Form,
and Midterm Faculty Evaluation Form can be found in the Appendix.
In addition to the aforementioned vehicles of evaluation, students in field placements evaluate
their University Supervisor using the University Supervisor Evaluation Form.
d.

Document how the evaluative process is used to identify strengths and limitations and how it is
incorporated in specific procedures for improvement.
Table of Contents
Response:
Using the Faculty Performance Appraisal Form, faculty members rate themselves and are rated
by the Department Chair as exceeding, meeting, or falling below a number of performance
areas, thereby helping to identify strengths and limitations. Specific techniques for improving
areas of limitation are discussed in individual meetings with the Department Chair and
documented as recommendations which are reviewed annually.
For each course taught by a faculty member, final student evaluations serve as another method
for identifying strengths and limitations in such areas as methods, style and practice of
instruction, and course content. Faculty members are required to respond to the student
evaluation data by identifying strengths, concerns, and intended corrective actions. This process
encourages reflection on, and incorporation of, specific procedures for improvement. See
Faculty Response to Student Evaluation Data Form.
In addition, students evaluate faculty members at midterm. This information is valuable to
faculty members in adjusting instruction to meet the needs of students in each of their classes.
Midterm evaluations are reviewed solely by each faculty member.

e.

​

Describe how faculty and staff are provided opportunities for relevant professional
development.
Table of Contents
Response:
A number of opportunities exist to promote faculty professional development, including
programs through Human Resources and initiatives within Academic Affairs. Faculty research
is supported through the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research which provides funding
for attending and presenting at conferences, grant writing and publishing workshops, hosts a
summer writers retreat (which has been attended by faculty in the department), a winter writing
workshop, and provides research and scholarship grants. A faculty development initiative with
Academic Affairs hosts electronic training workshops (Blackboard, Hoonuit, Office 365, etc.),
provides diversity and inclusion resources, and compiles information on teaching strategies and
supporting students. A regular interdisciplinary speakers series within the School of Humanities
and Social Sciences provides faculty with opportunities to discuss cogent issues across
disciplines. The Human Resources office regularly holds professional development workshops
on a variety of topics, including a faculty interactive workshop series, sessions on creativity,
conflict, leadership, and supporting students.
Funding for faculty conference attendance. Full-time faculty members are eligible to receive
funding to either attend or participate in professional conferences and also to conduct

​

research. Part-time faculty members are eligible to receive funding only if they are
presenting at a professional conference. Funds may be requested for conferences,
conventions, or workshops. There is no geographic limit on the requests that may be
considered.

H. Cultural Competence
Context: To ensure the program is effective in producing culturally competent professionals who
possess high level of self-awareness, knowledge, and skills in the complexities of
multiculturalism. This encompasses the individual, family, and group levels as well as
agency/organizational, community, and globally.
Standard 8: The program shall foster the development of culturally competent professionals
through program characteristics, curriculum, and fieldwork.
Specifications for Standard 8:
a.

Demonstrate how the program
1.​ Includes cultural competence in program policies, procedures, and practices.
Table of Contents
Response: Cultural competence is deeply embedded in the Counseling & Human Services
program and throughout Stevenson University. One of the campus leaders in cultural
competence issues, Lauri Weiner, is a full-time faculty member in the department. She teaches
the required course CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence, serves on a college-wide
diversity task force, and has facilitated or co-led an ongoing series of faculty/student
conversations on diversity for the past several years. Cultural competence is #4 of the six
program outcomes. Professional expectations are emphasized throughout the program, but are
included as prerequisites for participation in field experiences. These expectations explicitly
include culturally sensitive behavior (item #1), as described in the student handbook. As
indicated below, cultural competence skills are emphasized in multiple ways throughout the
program and students are provided opportunities to develop and practice these skills. If a student
continues to violate these expectations after repeated attempts to remediate the issue, this can be
a basis for removal from the program (see Standard 5c and d).
2.​ Includes cultural competence training for faculty and staff
Response: Institutionally, Stevenson University is committed to promoting cultural awareness
and sensitivity in students, faculty and staff. A college-wide taskforce is working on developing
systematic requirements for faculty to engage in cultural competence training. Currently,
participation in training opportunities is voluntary. Through Academic Affairs Faculty
Development, Diversity and Inclusion resources are available to faculty, including programs on
Inclusivity in the Classroom, Language Variation in the Classroom, Confronting the Lies I Tell
Myself, and a Peer Mentoring program for faculty. Human Resources offers periodic trainings
related to diversity and cultural competence for the college community. Within the Counseling
& Human Services Department, monthly faculty meetings regularly include discussions of
student issues, which frequently relate to diversity and cultural competence issues. These
regular discussions help to keep faculty attuned to these issues and give us an opportunity to
have important conversations within the department. Prof. Weiner co-facilitates the

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

Page 33 of 511

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

“Conversations on Diversity” series, which involves 2-3 meetings each semester. These sessions
typically include students, and are also an opportunity for faculty within the School of
Humanities and Social Sciences to engage in conversations on a selected aspect of diversity.
Most faculty in the Counseling & Human Services department have participated in these
discussions regularly.
b.

Demonstrate how the curriculum integrates cultural competence:
1.​ Includes but is not limited to student self-awareness of own culture, biases, prejudice, and
belief systems and stereotyping.
Table of Contents
Response: The curriculum includes CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence as a required
course. As part of this course, students complete a cultural autobiography and write three
response papers that require reflection on their own cultural beliefs and experiences and how
they affect their perception of the world. This emphasis on cultural self-reflection is introduced
in the First Year Seminar (a 1-credit course required of entering freshmen) and carried
throughout the curriculum. For example, in the capstone clinical skills course CHS 430 Family
Dynamics and Interventions, students complete a detailed family of origin assignment that
requires them to think deeply about their own family/cultural experiences and how those
experiences have affected their perceptions and attitudes. Self-awareness is a key part of the
program outcomes (see #6).
2.​ Includes the development of awareness, knowledge, and skills of diversity and culture.
Response: Awareness and knowledge of diversity and culture are integrated throughout the
curriculum, as described above. Another good example of the incorporation of cultural issues is
in CHS 101 Family Studies, which is focused on the diversity of family structures and includes
an assignment asking students to research and report on multiple facets of a controversial issue.
Skills are developed through the application of knowledge in the field experience courses, CHS
380 Internship and CHS 440 Practicum. In these courses, students work closely with on-site
supervisors and with faculty to practice and improve their skills. As indicated in the field
placement evaluation, which is completed as a self-evaluation by students and as a formal
evaluation by supervisors both in the middle and end of both experiences, both self-reflection
and culturally appropriate behaviors are strongly emphasized (see particularly sections IV and
II). Students also practice culturally appropriate strategies through role-playing exercises in both
the group and individual counseling courses (CHS 315 and CHS 360).

I. Program Support
Context: To address student needs, human service programs require adequate faculty, staff, and
program resources.
Standard 9: The program shall have adequate faculty, staff, and program resources.
Specifications for Standard 9:

a.

Include budgetary information that demonstrates sufficient funding, faculty, and staff to provide
an ongoing and stable program.
Table of Contents
NOTE: provide the reader both with a program budget and with a description of how to read
and interpret it.
Response:
The budget is developed and proposed annually by the Department Chair and submitted to the
Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences. See the operating budgets for 2018-2019
and for the upcoming year (2019-2020).
The total department budget of $8,683.89 has been decreasing for the past few years as part of
across-the-board spending reductions. Discretionary spending is allocated among 10 different
categories, including professional development, student travel, department events, and gifts to
others. Funds can be moved across categories, or into new categories to cover expenses that don’t
fit in an existing category. To read the budget, the first column for each line item indicated the
amount ‘Budgeted.” The column labeled “Actual” indicates expenses charged to line. The last
column is “Funds Available,” which indicates the amount remaining in the line or the amount
over the budgeted amount. The FY19 budget shows expenses in two categories (office supplies
and printing) that did not have funds allocated to them. At the end of the year, negative balances
are reconciled with lines that have a positive balance. For the past several years the department
has been able to operate within the overall budget while providing outstanding experiences for
students and supporting faculty and community partners (field placement sites).
Specific expenses in each of the categories where significant expenditures occurred in this fiscal
year are noted below:
Salaries PT Student: This line is for hiring a student assistant for the department. We had an
assistant for part of the semester, but she was not able to continue due to her scheduling issues,
which is why the expenditures are small. Unspent funds from this line cannot be moved to other
lines.
Student Supplies: This line is books and supplies needed for classrooms.
Promotional Give-Aways: Includes printing of departmental brochures and engraved pens.
Professional Development: Registration at the annual NOHS conference for faculty.
Professional Development Travel: Hotel at travel expenses for faculty at NOHS conference.
Students Conference: Student recipients of the Professional Development Award are taken to
NOHS conference each year. This line covers travel and registration expenses for the students.
Membership: Professional: CSHSE departmental membership and NOHS memberships for
faculty.
Dept/Div Events: Food: Advisory board breakfasts; honors induction ceremony; graduate
luncheons; senior poster session refreshments.
Gifts to Others: Field placement supervisors/agencies are given gifts (engraved portable chargers
or pen/keychain sets) at the end of each semester as a token of appreciation for working with our
students. This also includes engraved business card holders for graduates.

b.

​

Describe how program and field experience coordination is considered in calculating the teaching
loads of faculty. It is recommended that consideration be given to distance between sites,

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

Page 35 of 511

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

expectations of observation, documentation requirements, number of students enrolled in the
field experience, and the characteristics of the student population.
Table of Contents
Response:
Full-time faculty members maintain a twelve credit teaching load per semester. The Department
Chair is released from teaching two courses during the Fall semester and two courses during the
Spring semester in order to fulfill the responsibilities of the Department Chair as described in
Standard 7.
University faculty members responsible for field placements include the University Supervisors
and the Field Placement Coordinator. University Supervisors are adjunct faculty who provide
supervision for students in their practicums. These supervisors receive payment based upon the
number of students supervised (3-4 students = 1 credit hour), which we (and the supervisors)
believe is a reasonable load given the expected observation and documentation requirements.
Distance is a consideration when assigning University Supervisors to students placed at particular
sites. See Responsibilities of University Supervisor for Field Placements.
The Field Placement Coordinator is a full time faculty member, Dr. Finkenberg who receives a
one course equivalency to develop relationships with and visit new agencies, liaise with directors
of agencies used previously, conduct classroom and individual meetings with all prospective
interns and practicum students, determine and approve eligibility of students for field placements,
and ensure appropriate placement assignments for all interns and practicum students. During both
Fall and Spring semesters, the Field Placement Coordinator teaches CHS 440 Practicum as part
of the teaching load. So teaching responsibilities for the Field Placement Coordinator are:
Fall Semester
Spring Semester
CHS 440 Practicum
CHS 440 Practicum
2 academic courses
CHS 380 Internship (usually two sections)
1 academic course
See Responsibilities of Field Placement Coordinator.
c.

Describe how the program has adequate professional support staff to meet the needs of students,
faculty, and administration.
Table of Contents
Response:
Secretarial support for faculty members and for the program is provided by the University
receptionists as well as the School of Humanities and Social Sciences’ Administrative Assistant,
who has been particularly helpful with producing departmental materials, such as handbooks,
certificates, and invitations. The departmental brochure is produced by staff in the Marketing and
Digital Communications Department. Their assistance is greatly appreciated.

d.

Describe how there is adequate resource support (e.g., technology, library, computer labs, etc.) to
meet the needs of students, faculty, and administration.

Specifications for Standard 10:
a.

Describe formal policies and procedures, and informal practices for the transfer of credits and
evaluation of prior learning.
Table of Contents
Response:
Transfer credits from other regionally accredited colleges are accepted through the SU registrar’s
office. Course equivalencies for Maryland colleges are determined through the ArtSys database
and in consultation with the department chair. A grade of C or better is required for a course to
transfer. The department chair makes determinations about what program requirements are
fulfilled by transfer courses and substitutions may be made as appropriate. See formal
articulation agreements below.
One course in the Program, CHS 380 (Internship in Counseling & Human Services), may be
waived if the student provides evidence of the successful completion of a minimum of two years
full-time employment in a human services agency. The student must submit the following
documentation for approval: (1) Professional Portfolio and (2) Letter of Recommendation from
the supervisor at the agency. The documentation will be evaluated by the Department Chair and
the Field Placement Coordinator. No other required human services courses in the Program may
be waived.
The University participates in College Level Examination Program (CLEP), which allows
students to take a CLEP exam to earn credits at Stevenson. The University grants credit to SU
students earning Stevenson University designated passing scores on CLEP exams. For further
information regarding acceptable exams, please review the Stevenson University CLEP Manual
available on the Transfer Credit Center page of the website under Credit by Examination.

The University recognizes the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme and will grant
credit for scores of 5 or higher in the "Higher Level" courses only. Scores of 4 will be taken into
consideration, but not automatically granted credit. No credit is given for courses taken at the
subsidiary level or for courses that duplicate others taken for Advanced Placement credit.
Informal collaboration efforts occur through faculty members’ networking during national
(NOHS) and regional (MACHS) conferences. The Department Chair is a member of the
advisory boards for two Associate Degree human services programs (Community College of
Baltimore County and Anne Arundel Community College), and the Program Coordinator for an
Associate Degree Program (CCBC) is on the SU Counseling & Human Services Advisory Board.
Board meetings provide opportunities for both formal and informal collaborative efforts. The
Department Chair began an Associate Degree program in Human Services at Prince George’s
Community College before coming to Stevenson and remains in close consultation with the
Program Coordinator.
The Counseling & Human Services Program at Stevenson University has developed formal
articulation agreements with the following programs:
Community College Programs
●​ Anne Arundel Community College
●​ Community College of Baltimore County
●​ Frederick Community College
●​ Howard Community College (in progress)
Graduate School Program
●​ McDaniel College – Human Services Management Program: Special Education
●​ Stevenson University – Healthcare Management
●​ Stevenson University - Community Based Education and Leadership
We have entered into Articulation Agreements with each of the above listed community colleges
because they allow students from each of the institutions to continue a path in the study of human
services which builds upon substantial courses already completed in the field. See each
articulation agreement in the appendix for course equivalencies.
The articulation agreement with McDaniel College allows Stevenson Counseling & Human
Services majors who complete CHS 515 and CHS 540 to be eligible to obtain a Master’s Degree
in Human Services Management: Special Education in one year.
Students interested in the Stevenson Healthcare Management or Community Based Education
and Leadership M.S. programs can apply to the BS to MS Option accelerated program and finish
the combined program in five years. The two graduate level courses (CHS 515 and CHS 540)
count towards the major and students can start taking graduate courses in the program during
their final year in the undergraduate program and pay the standard undergraduate tuition.
Students from Stevenson who want to transfer credits to graduate programs have the opportunity
to take two courses at the graduate level (CHS 515 and CHS 540). As explained in the response

Table of Contents
a.

The historical roots of human services as a discipline and profession.
Response: The historic roots of human services are covered in CHS 105 Human Services and
Social Policy through in-class activities, discussion, lecture, and assigned reading (see Course
Schedule; week 2 is devoted to the history of human services).
In CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, students read social science research articles that
influenced the development of the human services field and create a detailed research proposal
as a class assignment.
In CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions, students examine a variety of approaches to
family therapy that have historically been utilized. Working in groups, they analyze each model
and report to the class (see the course schedule and description of the group project).
In the Field Placement courses, CHS 380 Internship includes in-class discussion following a
journal assignment that requires students to become familiar with the historic roots of the
agency at which they are completing their particular internships. Similarly, students in CHS 440
Practicum, learn about the history of the agency where they are completing their practicum and
incorporate that into their poster presentations for CHS 441 Seminar at the end of the semester.

b.

Historical and current legislation affecting services delivery.
Response: Historical and current legislation affecting services delivery is addressed in CHS 101
Family Studies through discussion, media presentation, lecture, and assigned reading
specifically regarding family structure and the legislation that affects it. This issue is addressed
briefly in most chapters, but see specifically 3/28 “Issues in Contemporary U.S. Families” and
4/4 “Economy and Family Life” in the course schedule.
CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy addresses this issue through reading, lecture, and

Page 65 of 511

CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing includes an exploration of research studies assessing
the need for services and the effectiveness of interventions, which influence legislation. This is
addressed through lecture, discussion, and assigned reading.
CHS 340 Administration of Human Services covers legislation that affects service delivery
indirectly through its influence on how agencies are administered and managed. For example, a
unit on hiring includes legal issues governing this process (see course schedule) and a unit and
assigned project on seeking resources (Course Requirement #6) covers legislation regarding
fund-raising and finances (course schedule).
CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions examines legislation affecting service delivery
through a group project where student groups analyze in-depth different models of family
therapy, both current and historical. The analysis includes legislative issues affecting each
approach (see the Group Project assignment for detail and a list of the models covered).
Legislation affecting service delivery is also addressed in the field placement courses CHS 380
Internship, CHS 440 Practicum and CHS 441 Seminar in that students become familiar with the
legislative issues affecting their particular agency. This is often a topic in the Issues Presentation
project and is included in Poster Presentations about the agencies at which students complete
their practicums.
c.

​

How public and private attitudes influence legislation and the interpretation of policies related to
human services.
Response: There is an emphasis on how public and private attitudes influence legislation and
the interpretation of policies related to human services in CHS 101 Family Studies throughout
the course as the factors influencing various aspects of family are explored through discussion,
media presentation, lecture, and assigned reading. For example, the interpretation of laws
related to same-sex couples, divorce and remarriage and work and family life are considered.
The issue is addressed most directly and deeply in the unit on “Issues in Contemporary U.S.
Families” (see course schedule).
CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy addresses this issue through reading, lecture, and
discussion, particularly in the units on macro-level practice and social policy issues, which
include detailed discussion of public attitudes towards helping(see course schedule).
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing includes discussions about how research on social
issues is influenced by public and private attitudes and legislation (see week 2 in course
schedule). This is addressed through lecture, discussion, and assigned reading.
CHS 340 Administration of Human Services covers the influence of public and private attitudes
on legislation and policy through a variety of administrative issues. For example, see the unit on
“Working with a Board” in course schedule.
CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions examines the influence of public and private
attitudes on legislation and policy through a group project where student groups analyze
in-depth different models of family therapy, both current and historical. The analysis includes
legislative issues affecting each approach (see the Group Project assignment for detail and a list
of the models covered).
This issue is also addressed in the field placement courses CHS 380 Internship, CHS 440
Practicum and CHS 441 Seminar in that students become familiar with the legislation and
interpretation of policies that affects their particular agency. This is often a topic in the Issues
Presentation project and is included in Poster Presentations about the agencies at which students
complete their practicums.

d.

The broader sociopolitical issues that affect human service systems.
Response: Sociopolitical issues, including systems of governance and economics, are addressed
in CHS 101 Family Studies, particularly as they relate to family issues through historical,
national, and cultural contexts. Learning is accomplished through in-class activities, discussions,
media presentations, lectures, and assigned readings.
Sociopolitical issues are also integrated throughout CHS 105 Human Services and Social
Policy, particularly as they relate to the emergence of human services systems and the unit on
Social Policy and Intervention (see course schedule).
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing includes discussions about how research on social
issues is influenced by government and economic systems (see week 2 in course schedule).
This is addressed through lecture, discussion, and assigned reading.
CHS 340 Administration of Human Services covers the influence of government and economic
policies on a variety of administrative issues. For example, a unit on hiring includes legal issues
governing this process (see course schedule) and a unit and assigned project on seeking
resources (Course Requirement #6) covers both governmental (grants) and economic issues
(course schedule).
Government and economic systems and their relationship to family dynamics are covered in
CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions through a group project where student groups
analyze different models of family therapy. The analysis includes how each approach fits within
government and economic systems (see the Group Project assignment for detail and a list of the
models covered).
Differences between systems of governance and economics is also addressed in the field
placement courses CHS 380 Internship, CHS 440 Practicum and CHS 441 Seminar in that
students become familiar with the governmental and economic issues affecting their particular
agency. These issues are often a topic in the Issues Presentation project and are included in
Poster Presentations about the agencies at which students complete their practicums.
Required non-major course SOC 101 Introduction to Sociology includes frequent consideration
of governmental and economic issues related to sociology.

e.

​

Exposure to a spectrum of political ideologies.
Response: Exposure to a spectrum of political ideologies occurs in each unit of CHS 101
Family Studies , but see particularly “Selecting a Partner”, “Diversity in Marriages and
Familes”, and “Employment in Relationships” where different political perspectives on family
policy are studied directly.
In CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy, political ideologies are central to discussions of
the historical roots of helping and social policy and intervention approaches, as well as many
other units, which are covered through in-class activities, discussions, media presentations,
lectures, assigned readings, and out-of-class assignments. See especially the assignment “Issue
Presentation and Report”.
In addition, political ideologies and their influence on research are discussed in CHS 224
Research Methods and Writing. See particularly week 2 in course schedule on the foundations
of social science research.
Political ideologies and their relationship to family dynamics are covered in detail in CHS 430
Family Dynamics and Interventions through a group project where student groups analyze
different models of family therapy. The analysis includes how each approach fits with different

​

political ideologies (see the Group Project assignment for detail and a list of the models
covered).
Exposure to a spectrum of political ideologies also occurs in the field placement courses CHS
380 Internship, CHS 440 Practicum and CHS 441 Seminar in that students become familiar with
political ideologies that affect their particular agency. These issues are often a topic in the Issues
Presentation project and are included in Poster Presentations about the agencies at which
students complete their practicums.
Political ideologies, as they relate to the specific topics of the courses, are analyzed throughout
the required non-major course SOC 101 Introduction to Sociology and covered tangentially in
PSY 101 Introduction to Psychology.
f.

Skills to analyze and interpret historical data for application in advocacy and social change.
Response: Coverage of skills to analyze and interpret historical data for application in advocacy
and social change is accomplished through in-class activities, discussion, lecture, and assigned
reading, in CHS 101 Family Studies. In this course, students learn about the historical and social
roots of each topic addressed and consider ways that current conditions could be changed to
benefit families (see particularly “Marriage Relationships,” “Same-Sex Couples” and “Family
Social Policy”).
In CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy, the historical roots of helping are examined and
the notion of advocacy is introduced through the helping process and through social policy and
intervention. See especially the assignment “Issue Presentation and Report.”
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing is fundamentally about the application of data to
influence social policy and interventions. See particularly week 2 in course schedule on the
foundations of social science research and the unit on historical/comparative research (week 12).
The central project for the course is that students develop a detailed Research Proposal on a
topic related to human services.
CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions addresses the use of data to support different
types of family therapy interventions through a group project where student groups analyze
in-depth different models of family therapy, both current and historical. The analysis includes
historical data on the effectiveness of each approach (see the Group Project assignment for
detail and a list of the models covered).
Skills to analyze and interpret historical data for application in advocacy and social change are
also developed in the field placement courses CHS 380 Internship, CHS 440 Practicum and
CHS 441 Seminar in that students practice these skills as they relate to their particular agency.

2. Human Systems
Context: The human services professional must have an understanding of the structure and dynamics
of organizations, communities, and society as well as the nature of individuals and groups. This
understanding is prerequisite to the determination of appropriate responses to human needs.

related to families and report to the class on their findings (Issue Presentation assignment). CHS
105 Human Services and Social Policy addresses skills to gather and assess the quality of
information in a number of ways (See Course Objectives 1 and 7.). This subject matter is
conveyed by in class activity and a group assignment related to these issues (Team Research
Project). Lecture about these topics throughout the course corresponds with the class schedule
provided in the CHS 105 syllabus.
CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence requires students to gather and assess the quality
of information related to diverse populations (see particularly the Immigrant Interview and
Group Presentation assignments). CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing emphasizes the
critical analysis of research findings throughout the course, but see particularly the Research
Proposal project.
CHS 340 Administration of Human Services addresses skills related to assessing the quality of

information as a vital component of administration and management through in-class activities,
discussion , lecture and assigned readings corresponding to the syllabus.
CHS 380 Internship addresses these skills through in-class discussion (students discuss their

Included in the CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy course objectives are the objectives
that the student “describe how personal, ethical, and legal issues affect the delivery of human
services” (#4) and “specify how his/her personal values and goals relate to a career in human
services” (#6.). In addition, conscious use of self is explored through assigned readings, lecture,
and in-class activities (particularly the unit on the helping relationship, see schedule).
CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence emphasizes the conscious use of self as a
component of cultural competence, particularly a focus on self-awareness and the influence of
one’s own culture on perceptions and actions. See course objectives, the course schedule, and
group presentation and immigrant interview assignments.
In CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, students learn about the conscious use of self as it
relates to the influence a researcher can have on the data being collected (see Week 10).
Students develop a detailed research proposal that accounts for the influence of self.
The conscious use of self as a therapeutic tool is emphasized in all the clinical skills courses:
CHS 315/515 Group Counseling within the context of group counseling techniques (process
analysis paper; schedule); CHS 360 in the context of individual counseling techniques (Course
Objective 1; interview papers; schedule); and CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions in
the context of family therapy (see family of origin assignment; Genograms and Ecomaps; and
group project analyzing the application of family therapy models).
CHS 340 Administration of Human Services focuses on administrative issues, including
personal leadership and the use of self to form relationships and manage effectively (see Course

Objective #1; course schedule).
CHS 380 Internship, 440 Practicum, and 441 Seminar involve class or seminar experiences and
field placement experiences in which the conscious use of self is learned and practiced.
Objective 2 of the CHS 380 course is that the students “analyze their own natural style of
helping and its impact.” Students in the CHS 380 course use journaling, portfolios, and a
substantial Reflection Paper which incorporates several self-assessment tools to broaden and
explore their conscious use of self (Course Requirements 3, 4, and 5). In all field placements,
students are mentored and evaluated by their field instructor partly on their ability to accept
constructive criticism, analyze interpersonal strengths and weaknesses, and develop personal
goals and objectives (See Student Field Placement Evaluation, Section II). Students also
evaluate themselves using this tool.
The journaling and reflection papers in CHS 440 and 441, as well as the seminar discussions,
readings, issue presentation, lecture, development of the professional portfolio, and poster
presentation are all designed to promote conscious use of self.
b.

Clarification of personal and professional values.
Response:
The clarification of personal and professional values is emphasized throughout the Human
Services Program. It is specifically addressed through in-class activities and discussions, lecture,
in-class media presentation, assigned reading and out-of-class activities in the following human
services classes: CHS 105, 220, 224, 315/515, 360, 430, 380, 440 and 441.
Included in the CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy course objectives are the objectives
that the student “describe how personal, ethical, and legal issues affect the delivery of human
services” (#4) and “specify how his/her personal values and goals relate to a career in human
services” (#6.). In addition, clarification of values is explored through assigned readings,
lecture, and in-class activities related to self-assessment and becoming a helper and the helping
process (see schedule).
CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence addresses the clarification of values in the context
of diversity and cultural competence. Objective 1 of this course articulates that students should
be able to “identify one’s own ethnic heritage, history or cultural background, values and
assumptions and how this can affect one’s experience as a practitioner”. This is amplified by
Course Requirement 4 “Cultural Autobiography”.
In CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, students learn about the clarification of values as it
relates to the values that are attached to social science research (see Week 10). Students develop
a detailed research proposal that addresses the values and motivation behind the research.
The clarification of personal and professional values is emphasized in all the clinical skills
courses: CHS 315/515 Group Counseling within the context of group counseling techniques
(process analysis paper); CHS 360 in the context of individual counseling techniques (Course
Objective 1; interview papers); and CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions in the context
of family therapy (see family of origin assignment; Genograms and Ecomaps; and group project
analyzing the application of family therapy models).

c.

Awareness of diversity.
Response:
Awareness of diversity is emphasized throughout the Counseling & Human Services Program. It
is specifically addressed through in-class activities and discussions, lecture, in-class media
presentation, assigned reading and out-of-class activities in the following human services
classes: CHS 101, 105, 220, 224, 315/515, 360, 430, 380, 440 and 441.
Course objective 4 of CHS 101 Family Studies requires that each student be able to “articulate
the diversity of family life issues both domestically and internationally. Diversity issues are
addressed throughout the course and specifically in the assigned reading, lecture, media
presentations, and class discussions. See particularly units on gender, selecting a partner, and
same sex couples.
Awareness of diversity is addressed through readings, lectures, and discussions in CHS 105.
Included in the CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy course objectives is the objective
that the students “articulate how diversity among individuals, families, and communities may
affect the delivery of human services” (# 3). In addition, awareness of diversity is explored
through assigned readings, lecture, and in-class activities (units on special groups in need of
services and multi-cultural issues).
CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence is devoted primarily to an awareness of diversity.
See all course objectives, the course schedule, and group presentation and immigrant interview
assignments.
In CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, students learn about the role of diversity in social
science research (see weeks 2, 4 and the unit on comparative research in week 12). Students
develop a detailed research proposal that includes a consideration of diversity in the research
design.
An awareness of diversity is a primary objective and focus of the clinical skills courses: CHS

315/515 Group Counseling within the context of group counseling techniques (Course
Objectives 1 and 4 and schedule); CHS 360 in the context of individual counseling techniques
(see interview projects and schedule); and CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions in the
context of family therapy (see group assignment analyzing the application of family therapy
models, family of origin project, and Course Objective 5 “demonstrate sensitivity to differences
in family structure and social, economic and cultural background”).
CHS 380 Internship, 440 Practicum, and 441 Seminar involve class or seminar experiences and
field placement experiences in which an awareness of diversity is a primary objective. Students
are mentored and evaluated by their field instructor on their ability to demonstrate specific
culturally sensitive behavior (See Student Field Placement Evaluation, Section IV). Objective 4
of the CHS 380 course is that the students “demonstrate sensitivity to diversity.” Students in the
CHS 380 course use journaling, portfolios, and a substantial Reflection Paper which
incorporates several self-assessment tools to broaden and explore their awareness of diversity
(Course Requirements 3, 4, and 5).
The journaling and reflection papers in CHS 440 and 441, as well as the seminar discussions
(“Understanding Yourself”), readings, issue presentation, lecture, and poster presentation are all
designed to help students increase their awareness of diversity.
An emphasis on the worth and uniqueness of individuals is also stressed in PSY 108, and SOC
101, required courses in other departments. The topic is taught through in-class activity and
discussion, in-class media presentation, lecture, assigned readings, and out-of-class assignments.
d.

Strategies for self-care.
Response:
Strategies for self-care are emphasized throughout the Counseling & Human Services Program.
They are specifically addressed through in-class activities and discussions, lecture, in-class
media presentation, assigned reading and out-of-class activities in the following human services
classes: CHS 105, 224, 315/515, 360, 430, 380, 440 and 441.
CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy addresses strategies for self-care through class
exercises, discussions, lecture, and readings related to classes defining helping and the role of
the Human Services worker.
Strategies for self-care is an important component of all the clinical skills courses: CHS 315/515
Group Counseling within the context of group counseling techniques (process analysis paper;
schedule); CHS 360 in the context of individual counseling techniques (schedule); and CHS 430
in the context of family therapy (group project analyzing the application of family therapy
models and related assignments, readings, lecture, and media presentations designed to promote
increased self-awareness, reflection, and discussion of ways students can experience strategies
for self-care both in the context of their own families and in working with other families; family
of origin project).
CHS 380 Internship, 440 Practicum, and 441 Seminar involve class or seminar experiences and
field placement experiences in which strategies for self-care are emphasized. Objective 2 of the
CHS 380 course is that the students “analyze their own natural style of helping and its impact.”

Students in the CHS 380 course use journaling, portfolios, and a substantial Reflection Paper
which incorporates several self-assessment tools to help improve their strategies for self-care
(Course Requirements 3, 4, and 5). In all field placements, students are mentored and evaluated
by their field instructor partly on their ability to accept constructive criticism, analyze
interpersonal strengths and weaknesses, and develop personal goals and objectives (See Student
Field Placement Evaluation, Section II). Students also evaluate themselves using this tool.
The journaling and reflection papers in CHS 440 and 441, as well as the seminar discussions (
“Understanding Yourself”), readings, issue presentation, lecture, and poster presentation are all
designed to help students strengthen their strategies for self-care. One class session in CHS 441
focuses on burnout and self-care strategies (“Advanced Tools for Staying Engaged”).
e.

Reflection on professional self (e.g., journaling, development of a portfolio, or project
demonstrating competency).
Response:
The reflection on professional self (e.g., journaling, development of a portfolio, or project
demonstrating competency) is emphasized throughout the Counseling & Human Services
Program. It is specifically addressed through in-class activities and discussions, lecture, in-class
media presentation, assigned reading and out-of-class activities in the following human services
classes: CHS 105, 224, 340, 430, 380, 440 and 441.
Students complete a Professional Portfolio project throughout their curriculum. They begin the
portfolio in CHS 217, developing a resume and describing agencies they have visited. In CHS
380 they add to the portfolio based on self-assessment inventories and their experiences in
Internship. The portfolio is completed in CHS 441 and it designed to reflect their professional
accomplishments and personal insights throughout the program.
CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy course objectives include: 4) “describe how
personal, ethical, and legal issues affect the delivery of human services” and 6) “specify how
his/her personal values and goals relate to a career in human services”. In addition, reflection
on professional self is explored through assigned readings, lecture, and in-class activities
specifically related to the role of self in establishing a helping relationship.
In CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, students complete a project demonstrating
competency that reflects their professional self when they develop a detailed research proposal
related to an aspect of the human services field.
In CHS 340 Administration of Human Services, students complete two projects related to
professional self: they work as a group to design a strategic plan and they write a formal
proposal seeking resources (Course Requirements 2 and 6).
The CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions course objectives include the expectations
that the student be able to 2)“articulate how one’s family history influences perceptions of
family processes” and 5) “demonstrate sensitivity to differences in family structure and social,
economic and cultural background.” Related assignments, readings, lecture, and media
presentations are designed to promote reflection on professional self (Family of Origin Project).

B. Field Experience
Context: Field experience such as a practicum or internship occurs in a human services setting.
Fieldwork provides an environment and context to integrate the knowledge, theory, skills, and
professional behaviors that are concurrently being taught in the classroom. It must be an integral part
of the education process.
Standard 21: The program shall provide field experience that is integrated with the curriculum.
Specifications for Standard 21:
Table of Contents
As evidence of meeting this standard, programs must:
a.

Provide a brief description of the overall process and structure of the fieldwork learning
experience.
Response: (See Field Placement Handbook)
Internship During their junior year, students spend 90 hours (two mornings a week or two
afternoons a week) participating in a field experience in a professional human services setting
(CHS 380 Internship). This placement provides students with the opportunity to apply the
knowledge and skills they have learned in the program. Concurrently, they explore professional
issues in a seminar that meets one hour each week. The internship is an important precursor to
the practicum, which is a much more extensive and intensive experience. In the fall of their
junior year, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to determine eligibility and to
discuss placement interests. The Field Placement Coordinator then suggests appropriate
agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Practicum During their senior year, students spend a full semester in a 9-credit (410 hours) field
experience in a professional human services setting (CHS 440 Practicum). [Note the 12-credit
hour option (540 hours) was recently eliminated, since it was determined that the extra hours
did not add to the value of the experience, but did add significantly to student stress levels. Some
students who entered the program under the previous curriculum are still completing the
12-credit practicum, but most are being advised into the 9-credit practicum.] Like the
internship, the practicum experience allows students to apply the knowledge and skills learned
throughout the program. In the practicum, students function much like entry level staff
members and are valued members of service teams. Concurrently, students enroll in CHS 441, a
3-credit course entitled Seminar in Counseling & Human Services. The seminar provides
students an opportunity to discuss and reflect upon issues that may arise during the practicum.
Topics that are covered include the role of the student in a professional setting as well as issues
that pertain to the field of human services.
Students develop personal learning objectives and document progress toward meeting the
objectives by journaling with their faculty supervisor. As part of the seminar, students augment
individual portfolios developed in prior human services courses and present a discussion of their
experience at the end of the semester. Additional assignments may be required for the courses
or from the human services agency.

​

The semester before Practicum, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to
determine eligibility and to discuss placement interests. The Field Placement Coordinator then
suggests an appropriate agency or agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Guidelines All placements must be approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. If currently
employed at a human services agency, students may not complete their internship or practicum
as part of their current position of employment, but may arrange for a separate and distinct field
placement experience within the agency, if approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. A
limited number of agencies may offer paid field placements. Such placements are acceptable
with the approval of the Field Placement Coordinator.
Written Learning Contract. A written learning contract for each student is developed and
agreed to by the student, the University, and the field instructor. Through their seminar
experiences, students are encouraged to write learning objectives in behavioral terms that
describe specific actions and activities. Field instructors collaborate with the students in writing
the objectives, and the University Supervisor approves them.
Student Field Placement Evaluation. Students in field placements are guided and evaluated by
their field instructors and by themselves using the Student Field Placement Evaluation. The
field placement evaluation tool consists of six goals, which are also the goals of the Program.
Each goal is accompanied by a list of behavioral objectives. Goals and objectives are evaluated
as “Below”, “Meets”, or “Exceeds” Expectations, and evaluators have space to comment on
each goal or objective if desired.
Students and field instructors each complete the evaluation tool midway through the semester
and at the end of the semester. Field instructors write overall comments at midpoint, and both
field instructors and faculty supervisors write overall, final comments. In addition, field
instructors recommend a grade of Pass or Fail at the end of the semester. The University
Supervisor, however, has the final say in determining a student’s grade.
In creating the Student Field Placement Evaluation, we attempted to make it uncomplicated for
the field instructor to fill out and, at the same time, comprehensive enough to provide in-depth
information about the student’s performance in his or her field placement. Information from
students, field instructors, and advisory board members was instrumental in its development.
Comments from field instructors, the Advisory Board, and faculty members indicate that the
tool is user friendly both for those who are making the evaluations and for those who are
interpreting the results. This spring the evaluation was modified slightly to reflect revised
program goals.
Agency Evaluation by Student. Students in field placements evaluate their placement sites by
using the Agency Evaluation by Student. This tool consists of 9 criteria to which students
respond Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree, or Not Enough Data to Evaluate.
Four additional items permit students to comment on additional aspects of the agency. Finally,
students are asked whether they would recommend the placement to another student.

Students complete the tool at the end of their field experience and submit it to the University
Supervisor who, in turn, gives it to the Field Placement Coordinator. Please see Appendix 4 for
a copy of the instrument, or click here (students complete the survey online).
University Supervisor Evaluation by Student. Students in field placements evaluate their
University Supervisors. This tool consists of 13 criteria to which students respond Strongly
Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree, or No Opinion. A section for Additional Comments
and/or Suggestions is provided. See Appendix 8, or click here (students complete the survey
online).
b.

Provide evidence that one academic credit is awarded for no less than three hours of field
experience per week.
Response:
Students are granted academic credits for field placements. The number of credits is contingent
upon the number of field work hours. One credit hour is the equivalent of 3 hours of field work
per week for 15 weeks (one semester). Thus, students who participate in the internship of 90
hours (six hours per week for 15 weeks) receive two credit hours (plus one credit for meeting in
class one hour per week). Students who participate in the practicum of 410 hours (27 hours per
week for 15 weeks) receive 9 credit hours, and students who participate in the practicum of 540
hours (36 hours per week for 15 weeks) receive 12 credit hours [the 540 hour option is being
eliminated for entering students].

c.

Demonstrate that students are exposed to human services agencies and clients (assigned
visitation, observation, assisting staff, etc.) early in the program.
Response:
Field experiences are an integral part of each student’s total educational process. Their format
and duration vary according to the particular student’s status in the program.
Students’ exposures to agencies begin early in the program, when, as a requirement for CHS
217 Professional Development in Counseling & Human Services, students visit two different
human services agencies and interview a human service worker at each agency. In addition to
the information collected during the interview, students are encouraged to tour the agencies and
collect written documents (e.g., brochures, pamphlets, printed forms) describing the facility
which can be shared in class. Students present oral and written reports about their agencies.
Some type of field experience is incorporated into most courses in the program. For example,
students in CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence interview and write about someone
who is part of a family that relates to a topic the class is discussing, such as a person who is an
immigrant or whose parent/parents have immigrated to the United States. Each student in CHS
360 Counseling Strategies for Individuals conducts an interview with a “client” and submits an
audio recording and a systematic analysis of the interview.
Although not a requirement of the program, many human services students receive direct
exposure to agencies through their participation in the Human Services Club. As part of their
involvement in the club, students are responsible for both organizing and participating in
various activities such as the Stevenson University Fair, and the Johns Hopkins University
Children’s House, which provides housing for the families of critically ill children.

d.

Provide a copy of the current manual and guidelines that are given to students advising them of
field placement requirements and policies.
Response:
The Field Placement Handbook, which each student receives before participating in a field
placement, includes all necessary information pertaining to the field placement and thus
functions as a field work manual. The Field Placement Handbook is revised on a yearly basis.
Information about field placements, including prerequisites, can also be found in the CHS
Student Handbook.

e.

Provide documentation of written learning agreements with field agencies that specify the
student’s role, activities, anticipated learning outcomes, supervision, and field instruction. The
agreement must be signed by the appropriate agency director, fieldwork supervisor, program
instructor, and student.
Response:
A list of agencies where students complete field placements is in the Appendix. Most of the
agencies do not require a formal contract, but sample agreements with Kennedy Krieger
Institute and Sheppard Pratt, two of our larger field placement sites, are included. These
agreements have not changed in the past five years. A more recent agreement with Baltimore
County DSS is here. Upon the placement of a student with an agency, the Field Placement
Coordinator sends a letter of agreement to the agency confirming the placement and
summarizing expectations, along with a copy of the Field Placement Handbook, which
discusses all aspects of the field placement.

f.

Provide syllabi for required seminars. Seminars must meet no less than every two weeks.
Seminar hours must not be included in field experience hours.
Response:
See syllabi for CHS 380 Internship and CHS 441 Seminar. Students meet in class weekly in
CHS 380 and at least every other week in CHS 441 Seminar (for Practicum).

g.

Provide evidence that required field experience is no less than 350 (may include 250 from
associate level) clock hours of field experience with at least 100 of these clock hours occurring
in the junior and senior years.
Response:
During the junior year of the Program, students spend 90 hours participating in a field
experience in a human services setting as part of CHS 380 Internship. During the senior year of
the Program, students spend a full semester in a 9-credit (410 hours) or 12-credit (540 hours)
field experience as part of CHS 440 Practicum in Counseling & Human Services. Thus, their
total field experience hours will be at least 500 or 630 hours, all completed in their junior and
senior years (See syllabi for these courses).

h.

Demonstrate how the field experience provides the student an opportunity to progress from:
1.​ Observation to
2.​ Directly supervised client contact to
3.​ Indirectly supervised client contact to
4.​ An independent caseload OR assignment of administrative responsibility.
Response:
Both the Internship (CHS 380) and Practicum (CHS 440) experiences typically provide students
the opportunity to begin with observation and progress first to directly supervised client contact
and then to indirectly supervised client contact and finally to independent caseloads or

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

Page 111 of 511

assignment of administrative responsibility. For example, one student’s practicum experience
was with the Baltimore County Department of Social Services’ Adoption and Foster Care Unit.
The student began by observing other workers’ interactions with clients, reading case files, and
talking with her co-workers. Next, she was supervised as she interacted with clients. During
the last two months of her field placement, she had the opportunity to have her own cases; in
particular, she worked very closely with two children in foster care/pre-adoptive placements. A
young female teen that she mentored responded very positively to her interventions, and an
emotionally disturbed 10-year old boy delighted in working on his Lifebook with her. The
student also supervised visitations between children and their birthparent(s).
Every semester, the Field Placement Coordinator reviews evaluations of placement sites
completed by students and summaries of their experiences in order to assess the nature of their
assignments and duties while at the site. The Field Placement Coordinator also reviews reports
submitted by University Supervisors based on their visits to sites. When new sites are acquired
or current sites fail to provide either an assignment of an independent caseload or assignment of
administrative responsibilities within the agency, the Field Placement Coordinator contacts the
site to ensure appropriate assignment of caseload or administrative responsibilities. Field
placement sites which are not able provide assignments of independent caseloads or
assignments of administrative responsibilities within the agency are removed from the catalog.
i.

Demonstrate that field supervisors have no less than the same degree the program awards. It is
strongly recommended that field supervisors have no less than one level of degree above the
level of degree awarded by the program.
Response:
All University Supervisors have no less than one degree above the level of certificate or degree
of the students they are supervising. A master’s degree is the minimum acceptable degree to be
a University Supervisor.

j.

Demonstrate that the program continually monitors the progress of each student and performs
no less than one site visit to each field placement site per quarter or semester. The visit can be
held as a direct site visit or with appropriate technology. The technology that is used should
ensure that the field placement supervisor and student can be identified.
Response:
For each student’s internship (CHS 380), the Field Placement Coordinator maintains open lines
of communication with field instructors and students. This person communicates with each
intern through his or her responses to the student’s periodic journal entries and through leading
the weekly internship seminar. Students in practicums (CHS 440) communicate on a weekly
basis through journal entries to an assigned University Supervisor and corresponding University
Supervisor replies. University supervisors attend some seminar meetings and may also
communicate by telephone with students in addition to their visit(s) to the site. At least one site
visit to meet with the student and field instructor is a requirement of University Supervisors.
Journal entries are required because of the power inherent in them. The Field Placement
Coordinator, University Supervisors and students have found journaling to be extremely helpful
to students in analyzing and processing their experiences. Their reflections allow students to
make connections between classroom information and their field experiences, and also between
what they’re doing in the field and actual learning. In addition, students’ journal entries allow

​

the Field Placement Coordinator and University Supervisor to assess the student’s ability to
meet course and personal objectives, and to communicate with students about their field
experiences.
Field instructors are given the Field Placement Coordinator’s and University Supervisor’s
telephone number at the beginning of the placement with instructions to telephone if needed.
University Supervisors visit the agency at the midpoint of the semester to confer with the
student and the field instructor a minimum of one time during the placement. With input from
the field instructor, the University supervisors evaluate the student’s overall performance and
provide a final course grade of “Pass” or “Fail”.

Advisory Board Minutes
February 15, 2019
8:30 – 10:00
MEMBERS PRESENT: Loretta Elizalde, Tom Flis, Arthur Hill, Lauren Minnich, Human
Services Club Representative (Alyssa Livesay), Mayaugust Finkenberg, Tom Swisher, Lauri
Weiner, and John Rosicky.
Introductions: All members introduced themselves and their roles at their places of
employment.
Welcome: Dr. Cheryl Wilson extended her welcome and thanks to the board members for
their participation and talked about the departmental move to the Owings Mills campus.
Approval of Minutes: Minutes from the September meeting were reviewed and approved.
Human Services Club: Club representative, Alyssa Livesay, reported on the club’s activities
and plans. The club hosted a week of events in the fall sponsored by the National Alliance on
Mental Illness (NAMI). They also participated in a “Senior Prom” at Brightview and raised
$210 for the Out of Darkness Walk in the Inner Harbor. During finals week they hosted an
arts and crafts night. The club collected donations for Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital.
They will do another arts and crafts night in the spring plan to participate in a “Walk for
Wishes” event. This semester the club plans to decorate and distribute “Together we Rise”
duffle bags to children in foster care. An education session on domestic violence is planned
in association with the House of Ruth. The club is working to bring in more members and
increase participation.
Dr. Wilson mentioned grant money that is available to support club activities that incorporate
art. John mentioned the “stress bottles” that the club created, along with the First Year
Seminar group, during Mustangs Make a Difference Day. Tom Flis from Sheppard Pratt
volunteered to speak at any club activities about internship opportunities. A suggestion was
made about partnering with other clubs for activities.
Field Experiences Summary: Mayaugust Finkenberg reported on field placements this
semester. Currently, 28 students are in internships and 17 students are in practicum
placements. There are no new placements for practicum students this semester, but a new site
near campus is working with an intern: Maximum Day Services, a medical day treatment and
substance abuse program. Six students are at Sheppard Pratt, four are at St. Vincent’s and
three are at St. Elizabeth School.

Department Overview
Department Move: The department has successfully transitioned to the Owings Mills North
campus and all were welcomed to our new home. Having classes on this campus has already
helped with enrollments and we are looking forward to continued growth. We continue to
work on making our space more welcoming. Loretta suggested signage to help people find
the offices.
Program Revisions: The name of the department has been changed to Counseling & Human
Services. Course designators will be changed to CHS starting this fall. Mayaugust described
how the new Trauma and Crisis Intervention course is going and said that students were
enthusiastic, including several criminal justice majors who add a different perspective on
crisis. This course will be offered every other spring semester. Next spring Tom will be
teaching another new course on coping, resilience and growth-focused counseling. He spoke
about plans for that course. Mayaugust will be teaching Professional Development in
Counseling & Human Services for the first time in the fall. This course will include a
speakers series about career opportunities and the development of professional portfolios.
We talked about moving to the use of ePortfolios. Several free options are available.
Members of the board thought that was a good idea and mentioned that other schools,
including Johns Hopkins, are using them. Arthur will send contact information on someone
who is using them. Blackboard was suggested as a possible resource, as well as asking other
chairs and contacting career services at SU.
January Term Trips: John described his January term trip to Ecuador with students, which
was successful. We hope to continue offering these experiences.
Reaccreditation: This semester, John will be working on writing a self-report on the status of
the department for CSHSE reaccreditation. The board may need to provide supporting
information.
Enrollment Statistics: Statistics on student enrollment continue to show a downward trend
(see attached chart). This spring we have a total of 78 majors and 20 minors. We need to
make continuing efforts to recruit students and emphasize the unique strengths of the
Counseling & Human Services program through marketing and publicity efforts. The name
change and move to the OM campus should be helpful in that regard.
Advisory Board Input:
Loretta announced that she can take students seeking field experience now that she has
moved into a new location in Pikesville. She is developing a number of groups, including
men’s and women’s groups, LGBT, couples, families and first responders. Lauren said that
the Target program is very happy with SU students who are working there, including Chris
and Abbey. Sheppard Pratt has a total of 15 interns and almost half of them are from
Stevenson. A trauma unit at SP is something that students from the Trauma and Crisis
Intervention class may be interested in exploring. Arthur mentioned that Project Search, near
3

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

Johns Hopkins, is a program that seeks to place individuals with disabilities. There may be
internship opportunities there – Arthur will send contact information to Mayaugust.
Upcoming Events:
●​ All are invited to the senior poster session on May 6 at 5:30 in the Rockland Banquet
Room on the Owings Mills campus.
●​ An honors induction ceremony will take place in April (details to follow).
●​ A panel of our alumni and representatives from a couple of graduate schools will be
speaking with our current practicum students on Feb. 25 at 6:00
NEXT MEETING: Friday, September 20, 2019 at 8:30 in MAC N120 on OMN campus.

MEMBERS PRESENT: Lisa Boone, Debbie Boyce, Candice Edwards, Loretta Elizalde,
Tom Flis, Arthur Hill, Erika Rue, Kathea Smith, Human Services Club President (Nicole

there is a continuing need to increase membership and participation in the club.

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

Field Experiences Summary: Mayaugust Finkenberg reported on field placements this
semester. Currently, a small group of 7 students are completing their practicum placements
and will graduate in December. Sites where students are working include: Irvine Nature
Center, Target Community Services, Urban Alliance, the Shaffer Center, Gilchrist Hospice,
Baltimore County Public Schools and the SU Office for Student Success.
Department Overview
Department Move to Owings Mills: The department will be moving from the Greenspring
campus to the Owings Mills North campus in January. Our offices will be located on a
hallway near the Center for Environmental Stewardship and the Sarah Manning Greenhouse.
Program Revisions: A new professional development course has been created and will be
offered in place of our professional writing class. Some of the writing projects related to
careers (resume, cover letter, portfolio) will be moved to this class. Other writing
assignments (literature review, needs assessment, grant proposal narrative) will be
incorporated into the research methods course, which will be become a writing intensive
course.
CHS 270 Psychopharmacology and Addiction will now be a required course and PSY 215
Psychopathology will become a focused elective (required in the Addictions and Mental
Health track).
Two new electives that were created based partly on student interest expressed in a survey,
will be offered in coming semesters: Trauma & Crisis Intervention and Coping, Resilience &
Positive Psychology. Mayaugust is working on and will teach the former. Tom is working on
and will teach the latter.
NOHS Conference: The National Organization for Human Service’s annual conference will
be in Philadelphia this year. Two students have been selected to accompany the department
and present a poster on the incorporation of field experiences into Human Services
programs. The students are: Izzy Ramsland and Annie Lerch.
January Term Trips: This January we will combine with a Service Learning course to run a
trip to Quito, Ecuador that John will lead, along with Rebecca Pisano, head of the service
learning and travel study programs.
Graduate Survey Results: Feedback from graduating seniors last fall was reviewed. Students
consistently point to their field experiences, and to faculty, as the most beneficial parts of the
program. Partly in response to student concerns, the number of hours required for the
practicum will be limited to 410 (9 credit hours). This is already the most common option for
students, but the 12-credit hour (540 hour, 39 hour/week) option will be eliminated.
Enrollment Statistics: Statistics on student enrollment continue to show a downward trend
(see attached chart). This semester we have a total of 83 majors and 16 minors. We need to
make continuing efforts to recruit students and emphasize the unique strengths of the Human
Services program through marketing and publicity efforts. In discussing the enrollment
5

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

statistics, Kathea suggested getting information from the admissions office about students
who are accepted into Stevenson but end up going somewhere else and what schools they
ultimately attend.
Board Input and Suggestions
All members for the advisory board described current events at their places of employment.
Lisa Boone gave an update on community college transfer issues and the status of a 4 year
degree option, which is on hold for now. Recruitment efforts and conversion rates seem to
benefit from personal touches. Arthur Hill reported that Kennedy Krieger has a new CEO
and is seeking interns for their programs. Sheppard Pratt has a new administration and is
offering diverse internship experiences, coordinated by new board member Tom Flis. He
advocated for a focus on BCBA certification, since there is a great need. St. Elizabeth School
is expanding its teaching space into the laundry building, which is being renovated. Debbie
Boyce will be leaving the advisory board, but was thanked for her years of dedicated
commitment to the Human Services program at SU. She brought Erika Rue to the meeting,
who will be replacing her on the advisory board. Candice Edwards described governmental
issues and reported that changes at the federal level have led to noticeable decreases in
funding for TANF and other social welfare programs, as well as an increase in restrictions.
There has been a crackdown on child support for non-custodial parents in the state and an
increase in eligibility for daycare.
Upcoming Events: All are invited to the senior poster session on December 3 at 5:30 in the
Pavilion on the Greenspring campus.

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

MEMBERS PRESENT: Lisa Boone, Debbie Boyce, Bunny Ebling, Candice Edwards,
Loretta Elizalde, Arthur Hill, Lauren Minnich, Kathea Smith (by phone), Human Services
Club President (Nigel Moore), Mayaugust Finkenberg, Tom Swisher, Lauri Weiner, and John
Rosicky.
Welcome: Dr. Cheryl Wilson was not able to attend, but extended her welcome and thanks
to the board members for their participation.
Approval of Minutes: Minutes from the September meeting were reviewed and approved.
Introductions: All members introduced themselves and their roles at their places of
employment.
Human Services Club: Club representative, Nigel Moore (President), reported on the club’s
activities from the Fall semester, which included the “Senior Prom” at Brightview, a
weeklong series of NAMI events, serving meals at Hopkins House in November, and making
PBJ and hygiene bags to distributed in Baltimore. This spring the club has planned an Earth
Day event, will return to Brightview for a recreation evening (possibly bingo), will read to
kids, sponsor several guest speakers, and participate in the Super Hero walk for Maryland.
Nigel expressed a desire to expand club membership and get more Human Services majors
involved (most active members are in nursing and biochemistry and most are juniors and
seniors). There is a need to increase membership and participation in the club.
Field Experiences Summary: Mayaugust Finkenberg reported on field placements this
semester. Currently, 21 students are in internships and 17 students are in practicum
placements. Sites where students are working include: Project Youth and JHU, Senior
Housing at Sunrise Assisted Living in Columbia, Turn Around – an agency dealing with
human trafficking, International Social Services (this placement has been affected by the
metro closure), House of Ruth, Mentoring Mentors (a program founded and run by alumnus
Alphonso Mayo), and programs dealing with domestic violence and teen pregnancy. We are
anticipating 9 students in practicum next fall.
Department Overview
Department Name Change: The program name change to “Counseling and Human Services”
has been approved and will become official over the summer. It is hoped that the change will
help with recruiting students.
Graduate Survey Results: Feedback from graduating seniors last spring was reviewed.
Students consistently point to their field experiences, and to faculty, as the most beneficial
parts of the program. Partly in response to student concerns, the number of hours required for
the practicum will be limited to 410 (9 credit hours). This is already the most common option
for students, but the 12-credit hour (540 hour, 39 hour/week) option will be eliminated.
Program Modifications: In response to student feedback and a departmental faculty retreat in
December, we are proposing several program modifications and board input was solicited. In
7

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

addition to reducing the practicum hours, we have changed the name of the addictions course
to Psychopharmacology and Addictions and will be requiring it of all majors. The name of
CHS 315 has been changed to Group Counseling (from Group Processes and Practices). We
polled our current students on which topics classes they would be most interested in taking.
The results are attached and were reviewed in the meeting. We discussed potential topics and
advisory board members shared a number of helpful ideas. Related to the low interest
expressed by students in classes on aging, Lisa Boone indicated that at CCBC a certificate in
Elder Care runs because it is offered online and attracts a number of returning students who
are currently working. A course in Crisis Intervention, including anger de-escalation, conflict
resolution, mediation skills, and burnout issues, was strongly endorsed, with Arthur Hill
noting that Kennedy Krieger has employees take Crisis Prevention and Intervention (CPI)
training. Candice Edwards suggested that a course related to immigrants, homeless and
diverse populations, including at least 5 hours of out-of-class experience, would be useful for
students. Some of this is currently covered in the required CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural
Competence. The growing importance of Applied Behavioral Analysis and the BCBA
certification in the field was stressed. This material is included in current counseling courses,
but could be developed into a separate course.
Other program modifications we discussed were:
●​ Requiring that at least one focused elective be an CHS course (this idea was endorsed
by the board);
●​ Moving a majority of the professional writing requirement into the Research
Methods course (all agreed that writing was an important skill that needs to be
retained in the program) and revamping the current professional writing course into a
sophomore Career Seminar, which could offer an opportunity for outside speakers
from local agencies and graduate programs (Bunny Ebling asked about our
connection to the MSW program at UMB and stressed the importance of students
knowing about the MSW degree);
●​ Requiring a course on Psychopharmacology and Addictions (the course is currently
a focused elective in the Addictions track);
●​ Removing the required LAW 259 Child and Family Law course; much of that
material will be covered in CHS 275 Services for Children and Youth and the CHS
201 Intro to Human Services will incorporate more material on legal and social
policy issues;
●​ Move PSY 215 Psychopathology into the Addiction & Mental Health track, so it is
no longer a required course for all majors.
January Term Trips: The trip that Lauri Weiner had organized to Arizona in January to
engage in social service projects on the Navaho Nation did not get enough students to run.
We will continue to offer opportunities for international social work in the Winterim. Next
January we will probably combine with the Service Learning office to run a trip to Quito,
Ecuador. Mayaugust has raised the possibility of a trip to Indonesia the following year.
Enrollment Statistics: Statistics on student enrollment continue to show a downward trend
(see attached chart). This spring we have a total of 83 majors and 20 minors. We need to
8

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

make continuing efforts to recruit students and emphasize the unique strengths of the Human
Services program through marketing and publicity efforts.
Upcoming Events: All are invited to the Honors Induction ceremony on April 11 at 6:00 and
to the senior poster session on April 30 at 5:30, both events are in the Pavilion on the
Greenspring campus.

Loretta Elizalde, Arthur Hill, Lauren Minnich, Human Services Club President (Nigel
Moore), Kathea Smith, Mayaugust Finkenberg, Tom Swisher, Lauri Weiner, and John
Rosicky.
Welcome: Dr. Cheryl Wilson, Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, welcomed the
advisory board and thanked the board for their participation.
Introductions: All members introduced themselves and their roles at their places of
employment.
Approval of Minutes: Minutes from the February meeting were reviewed.
Human Services Club: Club representative, Nigel Moore (President), reported on the club’s
upcoming activities, which include the “Senior Prom” at Brightview and serving meals at
Hopkins House in November. Nigel expressed a desire to expand club membership,
particularly within the Human Services department and to develop a transition plan for after
9

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

he graduates in May. The club maintains a Facebook page and website where photos of their
activities can be posted.
Field Experiences Summary: Mayaugust Finkenberg reported on field placements this
semester. Currently, 12 students are in practicum placements in a variety of placement sites,
including the Baltimore Child Abuse Center, Kennedy Krieger, St. Elizabeth School, Mtn.
Manor, Sheppard Pratt, and the Y of Central Maryland. We are anticipating 20 students in
practicum next semester and 22 in internship. Mayaugust is currently working with students
to find placements and already has three confirmed. New sites being developed include
Project Youth at Johns Hopkins, Turn Around (a program dealing with human trafficking),
and International Social Services. Ted described the field placements at CCBC related to
addiction counseling.
Department Overview
Department Name Change: A proposal to change the name of the program to “Counseling
and Human Services” has been submitted to MHEC. We are awaiting approval. This change
should help us to recruit students into the program. The general consensus at the meeting
was that this would be a positive change. It will be important for the program to be clear in
all materials that students will NOT become licensed counselors once they complete the
program.
Program Move to Owings Mills: It is likely that academic programs will be moving from the
Greenspring campus to the Owings Mills campus in the next couple of years. This is in order
to consolidate programs at the OM campus, so students do not have to travel between
campuses, and to take advantage of recent expansion on the OM campus. Several people
expressed sadness at possibly leaving the lovely Greenspring campus. It currently looks like
this would not happen until at least next summer.
NOHS Conference: Department faculty will be attending the National Organization for
Human Services conference in Des Moines on Oct. 18-21. Two students, Elizabeth Brown
and Rebecca Rohe, will accompany the department and present a poster at the conference.
January Term Trip: Lauri Weiner will be leading a group of students to Arizona in January to
engage in social service projects on the Navaho Nation, if she gets enough students to run the
trip.
Articulation Agreements: Agreements with CCBC and AACC have been updated and
signed. We will continue to pursue partnerships and welcome students from community
colleges to campus.
Graduate Survey Results: Feedback from graduating seniors last spring were reviewed.
Students consistently point to their field experiences, and to faculty, as the most beneficial
parts of the program. However, some concern was expressed by students about the difficulty
of completing the number of hours required and not getting paid. We discussed the
possibility of reducing the number of required hours, but there was also a commitment to
10

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

maintaining this vital part of the program. It will continue to be important to help students
navigate finding a balance between work and practicum.
Enrollment Statistics: Statistics on student enrollment continue to show a downward trend
(see attached chart). This fall we have a total of 87 majors and 20 minors. We need to make
continuing efforts to recruit students and emphasize the unique strengths of the Human
Services program through marketing and publicity efforts. Kathea Smith offered to help by
calling accepted students when the time is appropriate. She also suggested getting
information from the admissions office about where accepted students decide to go if they
don’t chose Stevenson, and why. Nigel suggested service events at local high schools.
Board Input: Board members described current issues at their places of employment and
provided updates on a variety of personal a professional issues. All of their input is greatly
appreciated.
Upcoming Events: All are invited to the senior poster session on 12/4 at 5:30 in the Pavilion
on the Greenspring campus.

Evaluation Results
2018-2019
Commentary on Evaluation Results
The results of the 2018-2019 Counseling & Human Services Program Evaluation confirm
that the present curriculum and field experiences are effective in meeting the program
mission, “to provide students with an educational foundation that will prepare them for
meaningful and effective careers within the human services field and successful continuation
of their education.” Student field placement evaluations also indicate that the program goals
are being met.
Twenty four students graduated in the 2018-2019 academic year. This is slightly lower
than the previous year, but represents a stabilization in the decline of graduates, which is
similar to the pattern for the number of majors. (see report below). The official number of
majors for the Fall of 2019 will be reported on the census date of October 15. A new
cohort of certificate students at Sheppard Pratt will be starting this fall, but the exact
number is not know at this time.

On the Program Evaluation Form and in the Senior Focus Groups, students praised their
CHS courses and the Human Services faculty. Some suggestions related to the curriculum
included an expansion of topics course offerings and tracks to include such areas as: child
life, disabilities and special education, counseling for children and youth, and school
counseling.
Several students questioned the usefulness of some of the general education courses and the
administration and counseling courses for those not interested in pursuing those areas. The
change in department name was generally positively received.

Part 2 – Summary of Responses to Short-Answer Items
1.​ What did you feel was the most worthwhile part of this program? Why?
Field experiences (internship and practicum) were highlighted in the responses to the
first question (over 75% of students mentioned this). Students appreciated the
opportunity to apply their classroom learning. Several students mentioned the support
and guidance they received and how much they learned about themselves. Some
specific courses/experiences were mentioned by individual students, such as the
addiction courses, administration of human services, and student presentations.

2.​ What did you feel was the least worthwhile part of this program? Why?

4%

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

Many students indicated that there was no part of the program that was not
worthwhile. Five students noted that the textbook for practicum was redundant and
could have been used in the internship. A few students felt that the demands were
overwhelming, particularly the practicum hours, while others indicated that the
internship had too few hours to be effective. Individual students mentioned specific
courses and experiences (statistics, focused electives/budgeting class, the portfolio,
and too much group work).
3.​ Suggestions for improving the program:
Only a few seniors offered suggestions for improving the program, but one theme
was the expansion of course offerings and tracks. Suggestions included: more
counseling classes, therapeutic play, disabilities, trauma and more psychology
courses. One student suggested that University Supervisors visit sites more often and
early in the semester to catch problems early. Another student requested more
graduate school articulations.

Would you recommend this placement to another student?
●​ Yes: 87% (21 students)
●​ No: 13% (3 students)
Summary of Results for Agency Evaluation
A majority of students (87%) indicated that they would recommend their placement to
another student. Four students (13%) would not recommend their placement to another
student. The CHS chair and the field placement coordinator have examined specific issues
and visited one site. For those sites that may not be beneficial to all students, placements
will be made selectively.
Seniors listed a wide variety of duties at their placements. They observed and assisted
supervisors, and planned, implemented, and assessed activities. Many reported that they
were responsible for general “office work” such as data entry and filing. Other duties
included intake and outreach and communication with clients, employees within the
organization, and the public.
Students listed many qualities that are necessary for success in the placements. Adaptability
(flexibility), willingness to learn, and patience were noted in most responses. Other traits
include empathy, ability to work independently, and good communication skills (including
listening skills).
Seniors commented on the challenges they met in the final field experience. These included
slow periods when there wasn’t much to do and a variety of job stresses.
Most students noted the support they received from staff at their sites and from their
University Supervisors. In general, students described the experience as challenging and
rewarding.

Student Field Placement Evaluations
Graduating Students

Summary of Results for Student Field Placement Evaluation
The final Student Field Placement Evaluations in CHS 440 Practicum in Human Services were
used to assess student performance on all 6 program outcomes, which were directly rated by the
students’ field supervisors. The goals were broken down into specific behaviors that supervisors
rated as ‘Below’ ‘Meets’ or ‘Exceeds’ Expectations. Supervisors could make optional comments
on each item and gave overall comments at the end of each evaluation. As background, for this
course students are working at area agencies for either 410 hours or 540 hours over the semester
(about 29 hrs/week or 39 hrs/week). Students work with the Field Placement Coordinator, Dr.
Finkenberg, to select theirs sites; they report weekly to University Supervisors who oversee their
progress is placements; but it is their supervisors at the agencies who complete the evaluations.
Evaluations for all graduates (35 students combined in fall of 2016 and spring of 2017) were
reviewed by both the Department Chair (John Rosicky) and the Field Experience Coordinator
(Mayaugust Finkenberg). The percentage of students who meet or exceed each item was
calculated. Comments were reviewed and shared with faculty, but were not included in the
analysis.
All students either met or exceeded expectations for each of the six goals rated on the Student
Field Placement Evaluation /survey. The field instructors’ comments were positive and
supportive. Students were commended for their professionalism, dedication, enthusiasm and
persistence. Many students demonstrated openness to feedback and constructive criticism and a
willingness to learn. In general students exhibited a high degree of caring for the people they
were working with and their efforts were appreciated by clients and staff.

These data indicate that all students in their senior practicum were rated by their supervisors as
meeting or exceeding expectations on all of the learning outcomes. Nine of the supervisors gave
the student they rated all “exceeds” ratings. In general, about twice as many students were given
“exceeds” ratings as “meets”, but there was some variation on individual items. Items II.C.,
III.B. and III.D. were meant to be yes/no ratings, so the “exceeds” option was crossed out, but
raters did not consistently use the “meets” option on these items; those who did respond used the
24

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

“meets” option, so those items were 100% “meets”. Items III.H. on speaking and writing
professionally and VI.A. on applying key concepts were close to 50/50 “meets”/”exceeds”,
indicating that students did slightly less well on these skills. A professional writing course was
added to the curriculum as a required course in 2014. Still, their performance was strong with no
students being rated as below expectations. One student was given a “Below” expectations rating
on punctuality, but still met expectations on Goal III. One student was identified as struggling
with punctuality.
We will continue to emphasize professionalism in all program courses and settings. In the future,
this may not be the best instrument to assess student attainment of goals. We plan to examine
student professional portfolios, which are developed in their seminar course, as well as an
assignment from the capstone clinical skills course (CHS 430 Family Dynamics and
Interventions). This will hopefully give us better data to distinguish areas of difficulty for
students.

In 2018, professional portfolios of seniors were analyzed.
Program outcomes assessed:
2.​ Based on comprehensive self-evaluation and feedback from faculty and supervisors,
develop individualized professional development goals and objectives.
3.​ Exhibit consistent professional attitudes and behaviors in applied human services
settings.
6.​ Synthesize and appropriately apply key concepts, methods and values in human services
to professional situations, independently and with minimal supervision.
Methodology:
Professional portfolios were collected from one of the two CHS 441 Seminar in Human Services
courses that graduating seniors complete in conjunction with their practicum experience in their
last semester. A total of 10 portfolios were examined (59% of graduating students). Each
portfolio was rated independently by two faculty members on each of the three outcomes, using
the attached rubric and a 3-points scale. Ratings were: Inadequate/No Evidence (0),
Adequate/Satisfactory (1), and Excellent (2). Raters gave the same ratings on 83% of the items.
When ratings were different, they were averaged together.
Data Summary:
The average scores on each outcome are listed below. On all measures, half or more artifacts
were rated as adequate. An addition 30-40% were rated as excellent. Three artifacts were rated as
inadequate by at least one rater (one for professional development goals and two for professional
attitudes and behaviors).

Identify which areas show the greatest difficulties with learning and which show the least:
The application of key concepts, methods and values (Objective #6) was most evident in these
artifacts. All artifacts were rated as adequate or excellent by both faculty raters.
The demonstration of professional attitudes and behaviors (Objective #3) was rated based on
professionalism of writing and presentation. Two artifacts were judged to be inadequate by at
least one of the raters. While 80% or artifacts were rated as adequate or excellent, there was less
consistency on this objective then on others.
Use of Results (to impact course, program, assessment process, etc.):
Students continue to struggle with consistently demonstrating professionalism in their writing
and electronic communications. While most of them are able to maintain an acceptable degree of
professionalism, this is an area that we will continue to emphasize. A new course was recently
created (CHS 217 Professional Development in Counseling & Human Services) that will stress
the importance of professionalism. We also continue to offer writing-intensive courses that
require students to practice good writing skills.

MISSION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNSELING & HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT

Mission
The mission of the Counseling & Human Services Department is to provide students with an
educational foundation that will prepare them for meaningful and effective careers within the
human services field and successful continuation of their education.
Purpose
The Counseling & Human Services Department prepares students to become effective
professionals in the helping disciplines. The program focuses on skill development, problem
solving, and the application of research and best practice principles. Students learn to help
others and to prepare thoughtfully and systematically for their careers. To meet these
commitments, the Counseling & Human Services Department offers its students a broad
curriculum, learning experiences and professional activities beyond the classroom, and high
levels of student-faculty interaction and collaboration.
The Counseling & Human Services program is designed to give students a comprehensive
understanding of how individuals and families develop and function. Students also acquire
the skills necessary to provide services to individuals and families. Therefore, the
coursework, in addition to courses that fulfill the University’s requirements, is composed of
(1) courses that emphasize the development and functioning of individuals and families, (2)
courses that focus on the skills required to help individuals and families, and (3) field work.
The curriculum incorporates theory, research, and application, with field experience as a
crucial part of the courses. In addition to the required courses, students choose five focused
electives that allow them to tailor their program to meet their individual needs and interests.
These electives are courses that have been approved by faculty members in the department as
being relevant to a career in human services, but are not specific requirements.
Students may pursue a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts degree in Counseling &
Human Services. The Bachelor of Arts degree requires the completion of at least two courses
in a foreign language at the intermediate level or above.
DEPARTMENT ACCREDITATION
The Counseling & Human Services Department is nationally accredited by the Council for
Standards in Human Service Education. By achieving accreditation, the Department has
been nationally recognized as a program whose competence warrants public and professional

GRADUATE SCHOOL AND CAREER PREPARATION
[Handbook]

Counseling & Human Services graduates are well prepared both to enter graduate programs such
as social work, human services, counseling, and school counseling and to assume careers in
human services. The major’s curriculum of theory and skills courses emphasizes field
experiences, which are a significant part of this preparation. These experiences range from
conducting an observation or interview in the introductory course to participating in a 410 or
540-hour practicum during the senior year. The experiences enable our students to prepare for
careers by:
●​ applying theory to practice,
●​ associating with professional mentors,
●​ evaluating their appropriateness for a career in human services,
●​ connecting with possible job opportunities,
●​ developing critical professional skills in team work, problem solving,
counseling/interviewing, and interpersonal relations, and
●​ enhancing essential personal qualities such as dependability, responsibility, and
reliability.
Human services majors at Stevenson University have the opportunity to complete their B.S. in
Human Services from Stevenson University and M.S. in Human Services Management:
Special Education from McDaniel College in 5 years. Students who intend to apply for this
program should enroll in CHS 515 and CHS 540 instead of CHS 315 and CHS 340. Students
who have been accepted into the Human Services Management program may enroll in McDaniel
College’s EDU 550 Research Methodology, during their senior year at Stevenson University.
Accepted students participating in CHS 440 will be required to complete a minimum of 50% of
their field placement hours with Target Community and Educational Services.
Students may complete the M.S. in Healthcare Management at Stevenson University or the
M.S. in Community Based Education and Leadership following graduation. Either of these
two degrees may be completed in 5 years if students apply to the accelerated program in their
sophomore year and take CHS 515 and CHS 540 at the graduate level.
Graduates of the Human Services Department are prepared to take the exam for certification as a
Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) offered by the Center for
Credentialing and Education.
Graduates who choose the Addictions Track complete the academic work required for
certification by the Maryland Board of Professional Counselors and Therapists as a Certified

DEPARTMENT PROCEDURES

24

ADMISSION PROCEDURES

Once admitted to Stevenson University, students may declare a major in Counseling & Human
Services. There are no departmental admissions requirements. Students transferring from another
major within the university (internal transfers) and students transferring from another institution
(external transfers) should meet with the department chair to discuss how previously completed
courses will fit into the major and to develop a plan of study.
RETENTION PROCEDURES

The retention of students is critical to the department. Faculty advising, tutoring, and counseling
services support this effort.

Faculty Advisors
The cornerstone for the retention of students in the Counseling & Human Services Department is
the faculty advisor, who is important in helping each student achieve his or her personal and
career goals. Upon admission to the department, each student is assigned an advisor who is a
Counseling & Human Services faculty member. Faculty advisors assist in course planning and
are a source of information about the department and about the college in general. Although it is
the responsibility of the student to become familiar with academic regulations presented in
university publications, the advisor can provide background knowledge and assistance, with
emphasis on the student’s own decision-making. Advisors schedule weekly office hours and are
available for individually requested appointments.
Tutoring (The Academic Link)
The Academic Link, nationally certified by the College Reading and Learning Association, serves
as Stevenson University’s tutoring and academic assistance center, offering free tutoring in most
courses to all enrolled students. Students work with dedicated peer and faculty tutors as a team
to learn effective study strategies, increase understanding of course content, and become
independent learners. The Link’s web site (http://academiclink.stevensonuniversity.org/) lists
many of the services and resources available.
Counseling Services
From time to time, most people go through stages of growth that present unique and challenging
decisions. The Wellness Center provides a wide variety of services, in both group and individual
settings, to aid members of the student community in clarifying personal concerns and reaching
decisions. Counselors, who are trained, objective professionals, are available to assist students
by providing an opportunity to talk and receive feedback in a setting that is confidential and
comfortable.

DISMISSAL PROCEDURES

Satisfactory performance in CHS 380 (internship and accompanying seminar) is required for the
practicum (CHS 440). Unsatisfactory performance (a grade below C) in CHS 380 will result in
25

ineligibility for CHS 440. Students whose performance in CHS 380 is unsatisfactory are
permitted to repeat the course. A second grade below C in CHS 380 will result in dismissal from
the major.
In order to be eligible for the practicum (CHS 440), students must have a 2.5 overall GPA and
demonstrate adequate professionalism, as assessed by faculty. Any concerns related to meeting
professional expectations will be communicated to students (see next section). Students who do
not meet professional expectations, or have below a 2.5 GPA by the end of the semester before
their practicum placement, will not be allowed to register for CHS 440 and may need to switch
majors.
ETHICS

Professional integrity is essential. Ethical behavior is expected and required of students both in
their academic work and in their field work.
Academic Honesty
To promote the free exchange of ideas, the Stevenson University community depends upon the
academic honesty of all of its members. While acknowledging that the vast majority of students
conduct themselves with a fundamental honesty, the college seeks to set the highest ethical
standards. For students, academic honesty is merely a prelude to the personal integrity and
professional ethics that will govern their careers. All forms of academic dishonesty (including,
but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized assistance, fabrication, and multiple
submissions) are subject to the sanctions stipulated in the University’s Student Policy Manual.
Ethics in Field Work
Ethical behavior in the field involves making sound decisions concerning issues such as
confidentiality. Information regarding clients/personnel must be kept confidential and shared
only in an appropriate professional context. Confidentiality is a significant aspect of
professionalism and must be maintained at all times. Standards that address confidentiality and
other ethical issues are contained in the code of standards of the National Organization for
Human Services (Please see Appendix).

SECTION III:
Field Placement Information

27

OVERVIEW OF FIELD PLACEMENTS
Internship
During their junior year, students spend 90 hours (two mornings a week or two afternoons a
week) participating in a field experience in a non-profit, human services setting (CHS 380). This
placement provides students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills they have
learned in the program. Concurrently, they explore professional issues in a seminar that meets
one hour each week. The internship is an important precursor to the practicum, which is a much
more extensive and intensive experience.
In the fall of their junior year, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to determine
eligibility and to discuss placement interests. The Field Placement Coordinator then suggests
appropriate agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Practicum
During their senior year, students spend a full semester in a 9-credit (410 hours) field experience
in a professional human services setting (CHS 440). Like the internship, the practicum
experience allows students to apply the knowledge and skills learned throughout the program. In
the practicum, students function much like entry level staff members and are valued members of
service teams. Concurrently, students enroll in CHS 441, a 3-credit course entitled Seminar in
Human Services. The seminar provides students an opportunity to discuss and reflect upon
issues that may arise during the practicum. Topics that are covered include the role of the
student in a professional setting as well as issues that pertain to the field of human services.
Students develop personal learning objectives and document progress toward meeting the
objectives by journaling with their faculty supervisor. As part of the seminar, students augment
individual portfolios developed in prior human services courses and present a discussion of their
experience at the end of the semester. Additional assignments may be required for the courses or
from the human services agency.
In the fall or spring of their senior year, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to
determine eligibility and to discuss placement interests. The Field Placement Coordinator then
suggests an appropriate agency or agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Guidelines
All placements must be approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. If currently employed at a
human services agency, students may not complete their internship or practicum as part of their
current position of employment, but may arrange for a separate and distinct field placement
experience within the agency, if approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. A limited number
of agencies may offer paid field placements. Such placements are acceptable with the approval of
the Field Placement Coordinator.

ETHICAL STANDARDS FOR HUMAN SERVICES
PROFESSIONALS
National Organization for Human Services, Adopted 2015
Preamble
Human services is a profession developed in response to the direction of human needs and human
problems in the 1960’s. Characterized by an appreciation of human beings in all of their diversity,
human services offers assistance to its clients within the context of their communities and
environments. Human service professionals and those who educate them promote and encourage
the unique values and characteristics of human services. In so doing, human service professionals
uphold the integrity and ethics of the profession, promote client and community well-being, and
enhance their own professional growth.
The fundamental values of the human services profession include respecting the dignity and
welfare of all people; promoting self-determination; honoring cultural diversity; advocating for
social justice; and acting with integrity, honesty, genuineness and objectivity.
Human service professionals consider these standards in ethical and professional decision
making. Conflicts may exist between this code and laws, workplace policies, cultural practices,
credentialing boards, and personal beliefs. Ethical-decision making processes should be employed
to assure careful choices. Although ethical codes are not legal documents, they may be used to
address issues related to the behavior of human service professionals.
Persons who use this code include members of the National Organization for Human Services,
students in relevant academic degree programs, faculty in those same programs, researchers,
administrators, and professionals in community agencies who identify with the profession of
human services. The ethical standards are organized in sections around those persons to whom
ethical practice should be applied.

Responsibility to Clients
STANDARD 1 Human service professionals recognize and build on client and community
strengths.
STANDARD 2 Human service professionals obtain informed consent to provide services to
clients at the beginning of the helping relationship. Clients should be informed that they may
withdraw consent at any time except where denied by court order and should be able to ask
questions before agreeing to the services. Clients who are unable to give consent should have
those who are legally able to give consent for them review an informed consent statement and
provide appropriate consent.
STANDARD 3 Human service professionals protect the client's right to privacy and
confidentiality except when such confidentiality would cause serious harm to the client or others,
when agency guidelines state otherwise, or under other stated conditions (e.g., local, state, or
federal laws). Human service professionals inform clients of the limits of confidentiality prior to
the onset of the helping relationship.

35

STANDARD 4 If it is suspected that danger or harm may occur to the client or to others as a
result of a client's behavior, the human service professional acts in an appropriate and
professional manner to protect the safety of those individuals. This may involve, but is not limited
to, seeking consultation, supervision, and/or breaking the confidentiality of the relationship.
STANDARD 5 Human service professionals recognize that multiple relationships may increase
the risk of harm to or exploitation of clients and may impair their professional judgment. When it
is not feasible to avoid dual or multiple relationships, human service professionals should
consider whether the professional relationship should avoided or curtailed.
STANDARD 6 Sexual or romantic relationships with current clients are prohibited. Before
engaging in sexual or romantic relationships with former clients, friends, or family members of
former clients, human service professionals carefully evaluate potential exploitation or harm and
refrain from entering into such a relationship.
STANDARD 7 Human service professionals ensure that their values or biases are not imposed
upon their clients.
STANDARD 8 Human service professionals protect the integrity, safety, and security of client
records. Client information in written or electronic form that is shared with other professionals
must have the client’s prior written consent except in the course of professional supervision or
when legally obliged or permitted to share such information.
STANDARD 9 When providing services through the use of technology, human service
professionals take precautions to ensure and maintain confidentiality and comply with all relevant
laws and requirements regarding storing, transmitting, and retrieving data. In addition, human
service professionals ensure that clients are aware of any issues and concerns related to
confidentiality, service issues, and how technology might negatively or positively impact the
helping relationship.

Responsibility to the Public and Society
STANDARD 10 Human service professionals provide services without discrimination or
preference in regards to age, ethnicity, culture, race, ability, gender, language preference, religion,
sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, nationality, or other historically oppressed groups.
STANDARD 11 Human service professionals are knowledgeable about the cultures and
communities within which they practice. They are aware of multiculturalism in society and its
impact on the community as well as individuals within the community. They respect the cultures
and beliefs of individuals and groups.
STANDARD 12 Human service professionals are aware of local, state, and federal laws. They
advocate for change in regulations and statutes when such legislation conflicts with ethical
guidelines and/or client rights. Where laws are harmful to individuals, groups, or communities,
human service professionals consider the conflict between the values of obeying the law and the
values of serving people and may decide to initiate social action.
STANDARD 13 Human service professionals stay informed about current social issues as they
affect clients and communities. If appropriate to the helping relationship, they share this
information with clients, groups and communities as part of their work.

36

STANDARD 14 Human service professionals are aware of social and political issues that
differentially affect clients from diverse backgrounds.
STANDARD 15 Human service professionals provide a mechanism for identifying client needs
and assets, calling attention to these needs and assets, and assisting in planning and mobilizing to
advocate for those needs at the individual, community, and societal level when appropriate to the
goals of the relationship.
STANDARD 16 Human service professionals advocate for social justice and seek to eliminate
oppression. They raise awareness of underserved population in their communities and with the
legislative system.
STANDARD 17 Human service professionals accurately represent their qualifications to the
public. This includes, but is not limited to, their abilities, training, education, credentials,
academic endeavors, and areas of expertise. They avoid the appearance of misrepresentation or
impropriety and take immediate steps to correct it if it occurs.
STANDARD 18 Human service professionals describe the effectiveness of treatment
programs, interventions and treatments, and/or techniques accurately, supported by data
whenever possible.

Responsibility to Colleagues
STANDARD 19 Human service professionals avoid duplicating another professional's helping
relationship with a client. They consult with other professionals who are assisting the client in a
different type of relationship when it is in the best interest of the client to do so. In addition,
human services professionals seek ways to actively collaborate and coordinate with other
professionals when appropriate.
STANDARD 20 When human service professionals have a conflict with a colleague, they first
seek out the colleague in an attempt to manage the problem. If this effort fails, the professional
then seeks the assistance of supervisors, consultants, or other professionals in efforts to address
the conflict.
STANDARD 21 Human service professionals respond appropriately to unethical and
problematic behavior of colleagues. Usually this means initially talking directly with the
colleague and if no satisfactory resolution is achieved, reporting the colleague's behavior to
supervisory or administrative staff.
STANDARD 22 All consultations between human service professionals are kept private, unless
to do so would result in harm to clients or communities.

Responsibility to Employers
STANDARD 23 To the extent possible, human service professionals adhere to commitments
made to their employers.
STANDARD 24 Human service professionals participate in efforts to establish and maintain
employment conditions which are conducive to high quality client services. Whenever
possible, they assist in evaluating the effectiveness of the agency through reliable and valid
assessment measures.

37

STANDARD 25 When a conflict arises between fulfilling the responsibility to the employer and
the responsibility to the client, human service professionals work with all involved to manage
the conflict.

Responsibility to the Profession
STANDARD 26 Human service professionals seek the training, experience, education and
supervision necessary to ensure their effectiveness in working with culturally diverse individuals
based on age, ethnicity, culture, race, ability, gender, language preference, religion, sexual
orientation, socioeconomic status, nationality, or other historically oppressive groups. In
addition, they will strive to increase their competence in methods which are known to be the best
fit for the population(s) with whom they work.
STANDARD 27 Human service professionals know the limit and scope of their professional
knowledge and offer services only within their knowledge, skill base, and scope of practice.
STANDARD 28 Human service professionals seek appropriate consultation and supervision
to assist in decision-making when there are legal, ethical or other dilemmas.
STANDARD 29 Human service professionals promote cooperation among related disciplines to
foster professional growth and to optimize the impact of inter-professional collaboration on
clients at all levels.
STANDARD 30 Human service professionals promote the continuing development of their
profession. They encourage membership in professional associations, support research
endeavors, foster educational advancement, advocate for appropriate legislative actions, and
participate in other related professional activities.
STANDARD 31 Human service professionals continually seek out new and effective
approaches to enhance their professional abilities and use techniques that are conceptually or
evidence based. When practicing techniques that are experimental or new, they inform clients of
the status of such techniques as well as the possible risks.
STANDARD 32 Human service professionals conduct research that adheres to all ethical
principles, institutional standards, and scientific rigor. Such research takes into consideration
cross-cultural bias and is reported in a manner that addressed any limitations.
STANDARD 33 Human service professionals make careful decisions about disclosing personal
information while using social media, knowing that they reflect the profession of human
services. In addition, they consider how their public conduct may reflect on themselves and their
profession.

Responsibility to Self
STANDARD 34 Human service professionals are aware of their own cultural backgrounds,
beliefs, values, and biases. They recognize the potential impact of their backgrounds on their
relationships with others and work diligently to provide culturally competent service to all of their
clients.
STANDARD 35 Human service professionals strive to develop and maintain healthy personal
growth to ensure that they are capable of giving optimal services to clients. When they find that

38

they are physically, emotionally, psychologically, or otherwise not able to offer such services,
they identify alternative services for clients.
STANDARD 36 Human service professionals hold a commitment to lifelong learning and
continually advance their knowledge and skills to serve clients more effectively.

Responsibility to Students
STANDARD 37 Human service educators develop and implement culturally sensitive
knowledge, awareness, and teaching methodologies.
STANDARD 38 Human service educators are committed to the principles of access and
inclusion and take all available and applicable steps to make education available to
differently-abled students.
STANDARD 39 Human service educators demonstrate high standards of scholarship in their
scholarship, pedagogy, and professional service and stay current in the field by being members
of their professional associations, attending workshops and conferences, and reviewing and/or
conducting research.
STANDARD 40 Human service educators recognize and acknowledge the contributions of
students to the work of the educator in such activities as case material, grants, workshops,
research, publications, and other related activities.
STANDARD 41 Human service educators monitor students' field experiences to ensure the
quality of the placement site, supervisory experience, and learning experience towards the goals
of personal, professional, academic, career, and civic development. When students experience
potentially harmful events during field placements, educators provide reasonable investigation
and response as necessary to safeguard the student.
STANDARD 42 Human service educators establish and uphold appropriate guidelines concerning
student disclosure of sensitive/personal information which includes letting students have fair
warning of any self-disclosure activities, allowing students to opt-out of in-depth self-disclosure
activities when feasible, and ensuring that a mechanism is available to discuss and process such
activities as needed.
STANDARD 43 Human service educators are aware that in their relationships with students,
power and status are unequal. Human service educators are responsible to clearly define and
maintain ethical and professional relationships with student; avoid conduct that is demeaning,
embarrassing or exploitative of students; and always strive to treat students fairly, equally and
without discrimination.
STANDARD 44 Human service educators ensure students are familiar with, informed by, and
accountable to the ethical standards and policies put forth by their program/department, the
course syllabus/instructor, their advisor(s), and the Ethical Standards of Human Service
Professionals.

OVERVIEW OF FIELD PLACEMENTS
Internship
During their junior year, students spend 90 hours (two mornings a week or two
afternoons a week) participating in a field experience in a non-profit, human services
setting (CHS 380). This placement provides students with the opportunity to apply the
knowledge and skills they have learned in the program. Concurrently, they explore
professional issues in a seminar that meets one hour each week. The internship is an
important precursor to the practicum, which is a much more extensive and intensive
experience.
In the fall of their junior year, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to
determine eligibility and to discuss placement interests. The Field Placement
Coordinator then suggests appropriate agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Practicum
During their senior year, students spend a full semester in a 9-credit (410 hours) field
experience in a non-profit, human services setting (CHS 440). Like the internship, the
practicum experience allows students to apply the knowledge and skills learned
throughout the program. In the practicum, students function much like entry level staff
members and are valued members of service teams. Concurrently, students enroll in CHS
441, a 3-credit course entitled Seminar in Human Services. The seminar provides
students an opportunity to discuss and reflect upon issues that may arise during the
practicum. Topics that are covered include the role of the student in a professional setting
as well as issues that pertain to the field of human services.
Students develop personal learning objectives and document progress toward meeting the
objectives by journaling with their faculty supervisor. As part of the seminar, students
augment individual portfolios developed in prior human services courses and present a
discussion of their experience at the end of the semester. Additional assignments may be
required for the courses or from the human services agency.
At the beginning of the semester before starting a practicum, students meet with the Field
Placement Coordinator to establish eligibility, discuss placement interests, and develop a
list of appropriate agencies for students to contact for an interview. Student eligibility is
assessed by the department, according to the criteria below, at the end of each semester
with final eligibility determined at the end of the semester before the practicum starts.
Guidelines
All placements must be approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. If currently
employed at a human services agency, students may not complete their internship or
practicum as part of their current position of employment, but may arrange for a separate
and distinct field placement experience within the agency, if approved by the Field
Placement Coordinator. A limited number of agencies may offer paid field placements.
Such placements are acceptable with the approval of the Field Placement Coordinator.

RESOLUTION OF FIELD PLACEMENT ISSUES
A field placement is usually a positive experience both for the student and for the agency.
Occasionally, however, the placement does not fulfill the student’s needs and/or the
agency’s needs. In the event of problems in the field, the following procedure should be
followed:
1.​ It is important to remember that the field instructor and the student share the
responsibility for identifying and dealing with problems as soon as they become
evident. It is crucial for the field instructor and the student to maintain open
communication and for the student to see the presenting problem as an
opportunity to learn more about his/her learning style and interpersonal skills.
2.​ The student and the field instructor should attempt to resolve the problem
together. If the attempt is not successful, they should inform each other of their
intention to seek additional help.
3.​ Both the student and the field instructor should notify the university supervisor,
who will obtain the assistance of the Field Placement Coordinator.
4. ​ One meeting will be held with the field instructor and the student to see if ​
adaptations beneficial to both parties could occur. The university supervisor will ​
mediate this discussion and determine whether the resolution process needs to ​
continue.
5. ​Effort will be made to maintain the placement. Occasionally, however, the ​
coordinator may decide that it is necessary to remove a student from a particular ​
placement. The reasons for this action range from inadequate supervision on the ​
part of the agency to a violation of the Code of Ethics on the part of the student.
6. ​ If a placement is terminated, the Coordinator will examine the situation to ​
determine whether an alternative placement will be made.

FIELD PLACEMENT PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES
47

1.​ Attendance Procedures
A.​ Excessive lateness will impair the student's ability to meet course
objectives. Therefore, students are expected to be on time.
B.​ Students must notify both the field instructor and university supervisor of
any absence prior to the experience. Students who miss more than one
day of their placement must make up the placement time. However,
students are not required to make up hours missed if the placement site is
closed and the student is not required to report; missed hours may not
constitute more than 10% of the overall required hours.
C.​ Students must document the hours spent at the internship or practicum by
completing a time accountability sheet. Use the SU form unless otherwise
required by the site.
D.​ A student having a major accident, illness or surgery, must submit to the
university supervisor a physician’s note.
E.​ Interns and practicum students are entitled to observe their own religious
holidays.
F.​ Vacation guidelines
1. Interns should follow the University’s calendar for holidays and
vacations.
​ 2. Students in a practicum should follow the agency’s calendar, including ​
holidays and vacations.
G. Students should be flexible and attend activities at alternate locations if
they fall on a placement day.
H.​ Students must be on site at their placements no fewer than 12 weeks
within the officially designated beginning and ending of a semester.
4.​ Agency Requirements
Students must participate in any requirements of the agency in which they
are placed. They may include but are not limited to training sessions,
orientation sessions, and background checks, which may include
fingerprinting. In addition, students may need to show proof of
immunizations received and receive any necessary immunizations.
5.​ Dress Code Guidelines
During the internship and practicum, students must maintain a
professional appearance at all times. The students are responsible for
following the dress code policies of the agency.

6.​ Transportation and Parking

48

Students are expected to arrange transportation for themselves either
through private or public means. Students are responsible for all
transportation expenses, including gas and parking fees. Travel time to
and from the agency is not considered for placements.
7.​ Confidentiality
Confidentiality is extremely important when working with clients and
families in the community. Students are expected to adhere to a strict code
of confidentiality. Students must handle all personal information about
clients, families and the agency in a confidential manner.
8.​ Special Issues
When questions or concerns arise regarding the placement, students
should discuss them with the field instructor and/or the faculty supervisor,
as appropriate. When in doubt, always discuss the issue with the faculty
supervisor.
9.​

Employment
Faculty members in the department believe that the student should NOT
attempt to be employed during the practicum. If already employed at a
human services agency, the student may not complete their practicum as
part of their current position of employment, but may arrange for a
separate and distinct field placement experience within the agency, if
approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. A limited number of
agencies may offer paid field placements. Such placements are acceptable
with the approval of the Field Placement Coordinator.
The practicum requires much energy and time. It is a rewarding
experience but at the same time tiring, due to the number of hours
committed to the agency and requirements. If a student’s financial
situation requires that he/she work, please consider the following options:

D.​
E.​
F.​
​
​
​

​
​
​

Try to save money in advance so that you will not need to work during
your final semester.
Apply for additional loans so that you will not need to work.
Apply for additional financial assistance/scholarships from the Financial
Aid Office.
If, after exploring the above options, the student decides that he/she must ​
work, limit working hours to the weekend so that during the week the ​
student can prepare appropriately and get much needed rest.

Welcome Back! We spent some time getting caught up with each other.
Updated Grading and Passing Standards
●​ John described the updated grading scale, which is in effect starting this semester.
There is no long a C- grade; a grade of C goes from 70-76%. There is no D+
grade; a grade of D is 60-69%. Students on the 2018-2019 catalog year only need a
D in order to get SEE credit for a course (this includes CHS 101 and 201).
HOWEVER, all students still need a C or better in courses for them to count as
program requirements.
Move to OMN Campus in January
●​ Our move to the Owings Mills campus has been officially approved. Our offices
will be in the Manning Academic Center: N172-174; N176-178. We spent some
time reviewing the layout of these rooms, looking at pictures, and discussing how
we could make the space accommodating to our needs. Lauri expressed an interest
in have N177 as her office. We need to specify which 4 offices we would like to
use and who will do in each one. The other two offices will be shared with
adjuncts from other departments and won’t be locked, but we can use them for
space to meet with students. We will want to advocate for appropriate signage so

61

students can find the offices and for the ability to decorate and provide
comfortable furniture for students.
●​ In spring, all of our courses will be offered on the Owings Mills campus. We will
be able to essentially retain our current course times; exact locations of classes will
be determined once the schedule is developed.
Student Updates
●​ Kayleigh Treshman was in a car accident. She is injured and will miss some class
time, but she will be OK. She had missed a couple of classes before the accident as
well.
●​
Department Issues:
●​ Thank you to Loryn for mentioning to folks at Levindale that we could possibly
provide training in medical technology. I am in talks with Ann Davis at SUO on
having us develop and provide non-credit training at both NCIA and at Levindale.
Loryn will work with us on this initiative.
●​ Mayaugust is putting together materials for CHS 362 Trauma & Crisis
Intervention. We decided to make it a 300 level class and include “trauma” in the
title. That will be offered in the spring. Tom will be developing CHS 365 Coping,
Resilience and Positive Psychology for the fall.
●​ The First Year Seminar class has 10 students. They will participate in Mustangs
Make a Difference Day on Oct. 12
Program Planning Discussion:
●​ We had a robust discussion about program planning in general. We discussed the
following questions:
●​ Why do students come to our program?
o​ Having had prior experiences with needing help; giving back
o​ Learn how to work with others
o​ A stepping stone to graduate programs in counseling and social work
o​ Interest in being a school counselor, because they had a good (or bad)
experience with their own counselor)
●​ What would our program motto be, if we had one?
o​ We make a difference
o​ Caring, Leaning, Growing, Giving
o​ Helping starts here
●​ What is our unique value proposition? What to students get from the program?
o​ Professional preparation/field experience
o​ The ability to apply theory to practice
o​ Caring faculty; personal mentoring
o​ A transformative experience; self-awareness and personal growth

62

●​ What challenges does the program face?
o​ Recruitment/growth
o​ Reputation of less rigor than other programs
o​ Retention – getting students to complete despite life issues/money; need for
support
o​ Need to recruit transfer students from community colleges
o​ Need to integrate commuter students and help them feel part of the
college/program
The following upcoming fall events and activities were briefly reviewed:
●​ Advisory Board Meeting, Sept. 21, 8:30-10:00 in Campanella
●​ Graduate Panel, Oct. 1 at 6:00 in library
●​ NOHS Conference, Oct. 25-27
●​ Admissions Events
o​ Open House, 9/22 (John)
o​ Open House, 10/13 (John)

Move to OMN Campus in January
●​ We will be moving to the MAC over winter break. Faculty have selected offices:
N172 (John), N173 (Tom), N177 (Lauri), N178 (Mayaugust). N174 and N176 will be

63

shared with adjuncts from other departments and won’t be locked, but we can use
them for space to meet with students. John will order boxes to be delivered to
faculty offices so we can start working on packing up. He will also work on
getting keys, signage and painting. We discussed other aspects of the move, as
well.
Human Services Club
●​ Lauri reported that the club is struggling and that officers are frustrated about
attendance and participation of CHS majors. Few, if any, CHS majors are showing
up at events such as the NAMI activities.
Student Issues
●​ Advising starts next week. Faculty should send email to advisees about signing up
for advising. John will send documents (sample program, focused electives,
general education (SEE) and course offering schedule). Advisers were encouraged
to talk up club activities and to keep student plans updated.
●​ We reviewed the list of potential practicum and internship students. Practicum
students are all in good shape. There was some concern about Kayla Chapman, as
she will be expecting a baby during the spring semester, which will likely impact
her placement. Several internship students have low grade point averages that need
to be raised in order to be eligible for practicum. Mayaugust expressed concern
about Alexis Grimes, who has not set up a meeting to discuss internship placement
or responded to requests. Mayaugust will send her an email indicating that if she
doesn’t respond, it will be assumed that she won’t be doing an internship.
Department Issues:
●​ The Trauma & Crisis Intervention course has been approved and Mayaugust will
teach that in the spring. Tom will work with John on the Resilience and Coping
class; John will send him the course approval form from the other course.

Student Issues
●​ Mayaugust is having a difficult time placing Destiny Stokes at an internship site.
Destiny has interviewed at three places and been turned down. She expresses
interests in administrative positions, but has not always followed through with
suggested placements. She is not interested in ARC. We talked extensively about
the issues involved and several suggestions were made about potential placement
sites. Destiny has interviewed at Progress Unlimited and thought the interview
went well. We’ll see how it goes.
●​ Kariza Govcalves was denied placement at the Shafer Center due to concerns
expressed about her safety in working with potentially volatile youths given her
visual impairment. The SU Disabilities Office is aware of this issue and based on
concerns about discrimination has requested that we not use the Shafer Center.
John will follow up with the new director of disabilities, Katey St. Clair Earle.
Kariza is progressing towards a placement at St. Elizabeth School.
●​ Jaylin Johnson continues to be a concern based on inconsistent attendance.
●​ Mayaugust indicated that Alexis Grimes continues to be a concern. She has
responded only when absolutely necessary. She considered switching to

65

Interdisciplinary Studies and spoke with Dr. Horrocks, but decided to continue
with Human Services. She still does not have a confirmed placement. It was
pointed out that the responsibility needs to be on her to do the work needed to
secure a placement.
●​ Noel Martin has decided to enter the major. Loryn indicated that her work and
attitude seem to reflect a high-school mindset.
●​ Kaitlin McMillan is failing CHS 101. She does not seem to grasp assignments
despite seeming to work hard. Lauri submitted an early alert previously. John will
notify the disabilities office about her struggles.
●​ Lauri spoke with Kevin Joppy about expectations that he was not meeting. He
was failing CHS 101 and several of his other classes at midterms.
●​ Mayaugust mentioned that Jessica Waugh has been late in turning in her work and
missing classes.
Department Issues
●​ In discussing registration issues, Lauri mentioned that several students have
expressed concerns about the Service Learning requirement in CHS 360. This led
to an in-depth discussion of how the service learning component of that course has
been working. At some sites, the work has not been appropriate for students or
there hasn’t been enough to do. Scheduling has been an issue and flexibility has
been granted related to the 20 hour requirement. Some students have stated that
they didn’t realize this was an expectation. John will add the designation to the
curriculum plan as one way to make this clearer. In early spring, we will make
service learning a continuing topic of discussion.
Move to OMN Campus in January
●​ We will be moving to the MAC over winter break. Faculty have selected offices:
N172 (John), N173 (Tom), N177 (Lauri), N178 (Mayaugust). N174 and N176 will be
shared with adjuncts from other departments and won’t be locked, but we can use
them for space to meet with students. Boxes have been delivered and we can start
packing whenever we want. A date for boxes to be moved can be scheduled when
we are ready (probably the week of Dec. 17-21, but Mayaugust indicated she
might want to wait until January). Book cases, file drawers, and furniture for the
hallway have been requested. John met with Janine Mills to talk about painting
one wall of our hallway blue and using the same blue as a background for signs
pointing the way to our area. The faculty lounge down the hall from our offices
has a full refrigerator, microwave and bathrooms. A scantron and copier is
available on south side of building. Lauri requested cleaning and vacuuming of
offices. Mayaugust asked about the possibility of having the hutch on her desk
moved to the other side of the desk. Lauri volunteered to act as the contact person
for the move in January while John is out of the country.

66

Department Issues (cont.)
●​ Departmental brochures have been updated to reflect the new department name.
●​ Kim Button has started work as the student assistant to the department. She will be
working on social media and promotional materials, but can perform other work as
needed.
●​ John asked about general stress levels on campus. The consensus was that students
were mostly focused on college-related stresses. There have been some health
concerns.
●​ We need another artifact for program assessment in the spring semester. One
possibility is the grant proposal assignment from the CHS 340/540 class. The
theory assignment from 430 will not work because it is a group assignment. We
could also use the portfolio again.
●​ This brought up a discussion about updating the portfolio assignment and
requiring an electronic portfolio. John and Lauri will both look into software
available for e-portfolios. To address the issue of students not making
modifications between classes, we could also have them include a “changes made”
section in the assignment. We will discuss the portfolio assignment in more detail
in the spring.
●​ Textbook orders are due soon. The CHS 101 text (Benokraitis) has gone to a new
edition and students will be purchasing access to an e-book. Faculty were given
copied of the updated edition.
●​ We talked briefly about gifts for practicum sites and others. John will ask Rita
about the portable cell phone chargers, or we could get more of the key
rings/lights.
The following upcoming fall events and activities were briefly reviewed:
●​ Admissions Events
o​ Open House, 11/17 (John)
●​ Senior Poster Session, Dec. 3, 5:30-6:30 in Pavilion
●​ Graduate Luncheon, Dec. 14, 12:00-1:00 in LRC
Spring Department Meetings (Fridays, 12:00-1:30) We can use N120 or N122 as a
conference room for these meetings.
●​ February 1
●​ March 1
●​ April 5
●​ May 10
The TUA induction ceremony will probably be held the second week of March. We
discussed room possibilities, including the use of the SOLVE center.

​
This was the first meeting of the semester and in the department’s new location on the
Owings Mills North campus. Loryn talked about her trip to Cambodia and China over the
winter break and John described the travel study trip to Ecuador. We hope to do another
trip in January 2020, but John will not be able to go, so someone else will need to step
forward.
Classrooms seem to be working effectively, despite a few adjustments. Students (and
faculty) are finding their way around the new building. We discussed use of OneDrive to
access, store and download/upload files. John asked if there were supply needs, since we
need to get our own now (Carol mentioned gradebooks). We discussed ideas for the
bulletin board outside of faculty offices – ideas included: current events “In the News”, a
list of field placement and employment sites, Ecuador pictures and other pictures of
departmental events.
Student Issues
●​ The deadline to add/drop in next Tuesday.
●​ Loryn will talk to Victoria Carter about switching her schedule so she doesn’t
have courses back-to-back on different campuses.
●​ Attendance verification is due next week.
●​ Field placements seem to be going smoothly. Lily Dondero has not been able to
start yet and Jaylin Johnson requested to switch his placement shortly before the
beginning of the semester, which was granted, but he is now having some
transportation issues. Villa Maria has been a concern – the school has been chaotic
and our students witnessed a fight and chair throwing incident. The residences may
be a better placement location in the future.
Department Issues
●​ We discussed the departmental acronym and course designator. It was agreed that
we should be consistent in referring to the department as CHS and use that as the
designator for all courses. There will need to be a systematic effort to let students

68

and other area of the college know about the shift. John will talk to Cheryl and the
registrar about this.
●​ Use gradebook in Blackboard was discussed. We will all need to start doing using
that feature in the fall. Several faculty offered to help anyone who needed to set up
this feature.
●​ Students have had some questions about the eText for CHS 101. Faculty have been
frustrated by a lack of clear instructions from the publisher and bookstore.
●​ The graduate panel for practicum students is scheduled for Feb. 25. Representative
from two graduate programs (UMB MSW program and the Chicago School of
Professional Psychology) will be included in the panel. We talked about a possible
articulation with the UM program as John has heard indirectly that they may be
open to this. If our students were able to get advanced standing when entering the
program, that would be very beneficial. John will follow up on this.
●​ Faculty evaluation forms are due by Feb. 8. John has communicated with faculty
as needed and apologized for the last minute request.
●​ The self-study for CSHSE reaccreditation is due at the end of the summer. John
will be working on the report through the spring semester and will need input from
faculty. He will be requesting specific information as needed.
●​ There was a discussion about moving to e-portfolios for students who are putting
together their professional portfolios. There was a general consensus that this
would be a good idea, but it was unclear how best to roll out that change. We
eventually agreed that we would let current practicum students have the option to
create e-portfolios as a pilot to see what they come up with. John will look at some
online options for free portfolio software.
●​ We will be examining the incorporation of service learning in CHS 360.
Mayaugust and Carol will be talking about this more before the next meeting. One
possibility (which came up after the meeting) was that service learning might be
incorporated in to the new CHS 217 Professional Development course instead of
CHS 360.

​
The meeting was held by conference call due to inclement weather.
Student Issues
●​ Nicole Rogers is having significant issues with her roommate who has a 30-year
old boyfriend who stays frequently in the room. Loryn recognized this from class
conversations and met with Nicole and Lauri. John has reported the issue to Sarah
Mansfield in residence life.
●​ Alex Lutz has been having some issues in practicum, not turning in
journals/reflections on time. The University Supervisor has expressed some
concern. John will follow up in seminar.
●​ Kevin Joppy continues to have poor attendance and student work habits in CHS
201 with Loryn. He did not register for to re-take CHS 101 this semester. Lauri
recommended an Early Alert, continuing to push him to meet expectations, and
will follow up with him in advising.
Department Issues
●​ The list of seven potential practicum students for fall was distributed. Steven
Sneed has a 2.375 GPA. He needs to get A’s and B’s this semester to bring that up
to at least a 2.45 to be eligible for practicum. He has been given this message
consistent for the past several semesters. His options, if he does not make the
cutoff, are to switch to Interdisciplinary Studies or re-take courses. He is doing
well in CHS 340 and 380 so far this semester; hopefully he will get the grades he
needs to progress. All other students on the list look like they will meet
requirements. There was a consensus that Tyler Steinberg general does the
minimum needed to meet requirements, although his grades have improved in the
past two semesters.

70

●​ We went through the course titles, descriptions and prerequisites for all courses
and added Counseling & Human Services where appropriate. John will submit
course change forms to the registrar’s office.
●​ Faculty were encouraged to submit academic integrity reports whenever there is a
suspicion of a violation.
●​ There will be no travel study option offered this January. We will plan to offer
another international study course in 2021.
●​ There was an extended discussion about options for taking students to a
conference as part of the Professional Development Award. We do not have
sufficient funds to take two students and all faculty to a conference that involves
flying to the destination. Options we discussed included taking students, but just
with one or two faculty; suspending the award for this year (but this will likely be
an ongoing problem); taking students to a regional NOHS conference in the
spring; or finding another fall conference within driving distance that we can take
students to. John was not able to identify a good option, but will look for a
possibility and let faculty know.
●​ There was a discussion about ways to reduce the overall number of credits
required by the program. It was agreed that it would be a good idea NOT to do
anything this year when we are completing the re-accreditation study. In the future
options for reducing the number of credits include: going from 5 to 3 focused
electives (keeping the requirement that two of those focused electives be CHS
classes); eliminating SOC 101; making the statistics requirement a
recommendation.
●​ It was agreed that CHS 217 would not be a good place for service learning, since it
is not available to non-majors and a major purpose of the course is to give students
exposure to a variety of career areas. CHS 360 will not be service learning in the
fall. CHS 201 may be the best place for service learning; John will talk with Loryn
about integrating this.

Student Issues
●​ Izzy Ramsland had another car accident late last night. She is OK, but has a
broken wrist. Candace Baker is following up with her about how she is doing on
time at her placement. She may need extra time at the end of the semester.
●​ Alex Lutz met with Mayaugust twice about ongoing failure to get her journals in
on time to her University Supervisor and general minimal effort, though she is
doing fine at Art with a Heart. We are still hoping for some improvement. Alex is
not in immediate danger of not successfully completing the practicum.
●​ Jaylin Johnson will not complete his internship and is switching to
Interdisciplinary Studies.
●​ Danzel Wright has been missing some classes and needs to continue being pushed
to meet expectations of student professionalism.
●​ Eboni Jackson has had issues with showing up late to class, but participates well
when she attends. She will hopefully pass 220 on her second attempt.
●​ Julia Ertel has been struggling with the interactive activities in 250. She came late
to class this week and wanted to jump into the mediation exercise that was already
in progress, but was not able to do so. Her social awkwardness can interfere with
her full participation.
●​ Kayla Chapman gave birth to a healthy baby girl on March 21. She plans to
return to her practicum placement after the Easter break and will need to complete
an extra month of placement after the end of the semester.
●​ Breyona Johnson was complimented by Mayo for her independent work on
developing a partnership project with Poly High School in Baltimore. This would
be a good opportunity to highlight accomplishments of both alumni and current
students.
Department Issues
●​ Cheryl provided some background on the development of the Community Health
program, which is currently being proposed as a new track in the Counseling &
Human Services program. There will be three new CMH courses (Intro to

72

Community Health, Healthcare Systems Administration, and a Seminar in
Community Health), plus a communication course and two BIO courses. These
will count as focused electives. Students in this track will not have to take two
CHS focused electives. The program is going before AAC next week. There was a
general consensus that this would fit well with our program and be a positive for
enrollement.
●​ Registration and advising issues were discussed. Students who still need LAW 259
may need to get a substitution (CHS 275 may work for many students).
●​ After a discussion of Graduation Awards, we agreed that JT would be nominated
for both the SU Pin and the Orsia Young Leadership Award. We will nominate
Alishia Foreman for the Knott award. Kelly Schwager and Alexis Young may be
candidates for the Provost’s Award, based on academic achievement.
●​ After a review of JT’s ePortfolio, we agreed that we would again give students in
the fall practicum the option to submit portfolios electronically or in hard copy. JT
used wixsite.com to do his portfolio. We will show the advisory board both an
electronic and hard copy of a portfolio in the fall to get their feedback on which is
preferable. When Tom Flis (from Sheppard Pratt) was doing a guest lecture in
CHS380, he was very impressed by the physical portfolio and said it would be an
advantage in a job interview.
●​ Following additional discussion about conference options, it was decided that we
will take two students to the national NOHS conference in Anaheim in October.
Tom got the Professional Development funding to attend and is awaiting
acceptance of his presentation proposal. Mayaugust will give internship students
the application and encourage them to apply by April 29.
●​ Service Learning will be integrated into CHS 201 in the fall.
●​ We reviewed upcoming events, including the Honors Induction on April 16.
●​ Lauri announced that Stevenson received a Jewish Life grant for $7,500 and that
she would be charged with administering it.

Student Issues
●​ Professional Development Award winners Alyssa Livesay and Rachael Caro were
announced and will be meeting with John and Tom to plan travel and poster
presentation.
●​ Steve Sneed reported that he is expecting a 3.0 this semester, which should be
sufficient to raise his GPA to close to 2.5 before his practicum in the fall. It was
unanimously agreed that if he gets to a cumulative GPA of 2.45 or higher that we
would “round up” and allow him to complete his practicum in the fall.
●​ Eboni Jackson has not completed work for Loryn’s CHS 540 section. She needs
to complete that course and can’t switch her registration to CHS 340. She is barely
passing CHS 220 and 270, but still may pull it out.
●​ Kim Button has been missing classes and assignments in CHS 220 and 315 and
there is concern about her status.
●​ Bella McCumbie continues to struggle with social anxiety disorder and was
recently granted disability accommodations. She has been missing classes and may
ultimately have difficulty progressing in the major.
●​ Hannah “Noel” Martin has had inconsistent attendance and may not pass some
classes (CHS 270 and CHS 340).
●​ Kariza Goncalves has returned from medical leave related to her vision and will
finish her internship.
●​ Kayla Chapman will also finish her practicum (she will have an incomplete
extension until the end of May) and graduate this semseter.
●​ Kaitlyn McMillan works hard, but struggles with a cognitive disability and often
seems to “not get it”, though her participation in class is good
●​ Melody Timmons will be returning in the fall. She has two more classes to
complete and then her practicum in the spring. She reports that it is likely she will
not pass the statistics course she has been taking at a community college. John will
look into possible alternatives to help her complete the program.
Department Issues
●​ The Community Health track has been approved. The course (CMH 210) is
available his fall, but so far has only 1 person registered.
●​ Congratulations to Mayaugust on her promotion to Associate Professor.
●​ CHS 217 Professional Development will be offered in the fall. Mayaugust will
teach two sections. CHS 201 will be a service learning course and John will email
students to notify them. CHS 360 will incorporate material on writing case notes
and have less emphasis on the theories of counseling. Carol and Bunny are
working on these changes.
●​ John will need updated CV’s from faculty for the self-report, as well as the
instructions for major assignments.
●​ We planned a social gather at John’s house in Crownsville the afternoon of July 11.
Invitations are pending.

AAC By-Laws

Academic Affairs Committee
By-Laws
The purpose of the Academic Affairs Committee shall be to research, report on, and recommend to the
Faculty Council actions relevant to the academic standards of the university. All recommendations by
the committee to the Council shall be in writing.
The guiding philosophy of the AAC is threefold:
o​ Peer-Review: The AAC encourages collaboration across disciplines and schools so that the
entire institution contributes to and is aware of academic conversations, standards, and best
practices.
o​ Alignment: The AAC looks for a clear progression of measurable competencies from the
course objectives to the course level description to the track objectives to the program
outcomes so that the AAC can chart the progress of students from when they enter a program
to when they leave a program.
o​ Assessment: The AAC is more effective if it has accurate and current information about SU
programs, so the AAC encourages periodic Program Review presentations.
Article I
Membership
Section I. Eligibility
Members of the Committee shall be full-time faculty members and shall be appointed by their
respective schools. Members must serve at least two years on the committee, and no school shall elect
two new members in the same year. The appointment cycles must be staggered so that only one new
member from a school joins in the same year.
Section II. Proportionate Representation
Each school (Business, Education, Design, Sciences, Graduate and Professional Studies, and
Humanities and Social Sciences) shall appoint two full-time faculty members. A representative from
the library shall also sit on the committee.
Section III. Replacement
In case of frequent absences by any member, the chair, with the consent of a majority of the
Committee, shall fill the vacancy.

111

Article II
Officers
Chair: The chair’s duties shall be to preside at the meetings, to serve as official spokesperson for the
Committee, and to appoint a substitute Recording Chair in the event of the Recording Chair’s absence.
The Vice Chair: The vice- chair’s duties shall be to act in the place of the chair of the Committee
when the chair is unable to carry out any of the functions of the office of the chair.
The Recording Chair: The recording chair’s duties shall be to record the minutes of the meetings and
distribute summaries of these proceedings to members of the university community, and to carry on
the necessary correspondence for the Committee.
Article III
Meetings
Section 1. Regular Meetings
Regular meetings shall be held once a month during the allotted time for committee meetings on
campus.
Section 2. Special Meetings
Special meetings may be called by the Chair, especially around deadlines.
Section 3. Quorum
A majority of the Council’s membership shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business (7
members including the chair) at regular and special meetings.
Section 4. Minutes
A complete and permanent set of minutes for each meeting shall be kept electronically. The Chair
shall send a summary report of the business transacted to Faculty Council.
Section 5. Parliamentary Procedure
The committee has adopted Robert’s Rule of Order as the official guide for all deliberations.

112

Section 6. Voting
Voting shall be by voice, by show of hands, or by secret ballot when requested. A majority of those
present will carry the motion. Also, proposals submitted to the Committee shall be either accepted or
rejected. There shall be no “conditional acceptance” of a proposal. If a proposal is rejected, a list of
reasons shall be provided. If a proposal is rejected, it may be resubmitted after consulting your AAC
School Representative. Commentary may also accompany an accepted proposal.
As outlined in Robert’s Rules, there is no “friendly amendment.” Once the chair has stated a motion,
it is no longer the property of the mover. Any amendment, “friendly” or otherwise, must be adopted
by the Committee, either by vote or unanimous consent. If even one member objects, then the
amendment must be debated and voted on.
Section 7. Submission Guidelines
Guidelines and meeting dates shall be disseminated to all Deans, Program Coordinators, and faculty
members at the beginning of each academic year.
1.​

All proposals must meet the outlined criteria in the AAC Style Sheet and the AAC Course
Proposal Guidelines.

2.​

All proposals must be vetted by the appropriate process described in the AAC document
“Curricular Change Process.”

This step will serve as a motion “to approve,” but there will be no discussion until another AAC
Representative seconds the motion. If seconded, there will be a short 5-minute discussion (the
initial Representative may yield his or her time to another person to lead the brief discussion) and
vote. If un-seconded, the motion fails and there will be no further discussion.
3.​ The deadlines for new course proposals will be disseminated each August.
4. The deadline for submissions for a Friday meeting is 10:00 a.m. the preceding Monday.
​
Section 8. Program Review Presentation Policy
Because the AAC will be more effective if it has accurate and current information about SU programs,
the Program Review Presentations are solely for the AAC's edification and are in no way connected to
the overall assessment of any program.
Section 9. Alterations to Process, Form, and Guidelines
Any substantial alteration to a process, form or guideline will not take effect until the beginning of the
following semester in which the alteration was approved by the committee

Associate of Applied Science degree in Human Services will be given every consideration
for financial assistance and will be eligible to compete for academic scholarships at

treated on an equal basis with students who began their studies at Stevenson University

Agreement between Stevenson University and McDaniel College
Graduate Program
Human services majors at Stevenson University have the opportunity to complete their B.S. in
Human Services from Stevenson University and M.S. in Human Services Management from
McDaniel College in 5 years. Graduates will receive a Bachelor’s Degree in Human Services
from SU and a Master’s Degree in Human Services Management: Special Education from
McDaniel College.
The McDaniel Program provides graduate students with a master's degree while completing a
live-in internship as a Community Living Manager (CLM) in a residence for adults with
developmental disabilities. In return for their internship as CLMs, students receive a 75% tuition
scholarship, a stipend ($18,000 per year in 2010), full health care benefits, and free room and
board.
Students who intend to apply for the Master’s Program at McDaniel College should enroll in CHS
515 and CHS 540 instead of CHS 315 and CHS 340. Students who have been accepted into
McDaniel College’s Master’s Program in Human Services Management: Special Education may
enroll in McDaniel College’s EDU 550, Research Methodology, during their senior year at
Stevenson University. Accepted students participating in CHS 440 will be required to complete a
minimum of 50% of their field placement hours with Target Community and Educational
Services.
Juniors will receive additional information about the 5-year degree program in the CHS 380 class.
Interested students must submit (1) a letter of interest and (2) a recommendation by a full-time
faculty member in the SU Human Services Program. Minimum criteria for the program are (1)
2.75 GPA and (2) acquisition of a Bachelor’s Degree in Human Services prior to beginning the
fifth year of their graduate studies at McDaniel College.
If students transfer 6 credits (CHS 515 and CHS 540) and complete EDU 550 during their senior
year, they will be able to complete McDaniel College's Master's Program in Human Services
Management: Special Education in 1 year (6 credits-summer; 9 credits-fall, and 9 credits-spring).
Only courses in which the student earns a grade of “B” or better are eligible for transfer.
Graduates with a master’s degree in human services typically work as directors, managers, and
coordinators for non-profit agencies, usually working with children and adults with disabilities,
but also with the elderly population. Some work for state or federal government agencies, for
example, the Developmental Disabilities Administration or other state service providers.
The following indicates the transfer of course agreement between the B.S. in Human Services at
Stevenson University and the M.S. in Human Services Management in Special Education at
McDaniel College.

Issue Presentations
The personal enrichment of each student is central to Stevenson’s mission; “enlarging
one’s horizons and integrating one’s total capabilities” are key elements in the fulfillment
of the mission. In the following assignment your horizon will be enlarged as you learn
new information and then integrate it by thinking about it critically and reflecting upon it.
There are many controversial issues related to families. In this assignment, you will
investigate one of these issues by reading and preparing for but not conducting
fieldwork. After you have collected your data, you will present both sides of the issue to
the class in a team presentation. In an individual written report, you will summarize and
react to a journal article, discuss your fieldwork preparation, and reflect on your topic.
The issues to be presented and the team presentation posting dates are as follows
1. Is Healthcare a Right? ​ ​ ​
​

​

​

Apr. 18

2. Does Marriage Matter?​ ​ ​

not be a duplication of another team member's article. Your Article Review will be written
on your individual article and you must submit a link or electronic copy of your article.
3. In addition to reading about the issue you are investigating, I would like you to conduct some
field work to gather the thoughts and opinions of others. This could include interviewing
someone with professional or personal knowledge of the topic, or surveying other students.
CLASS PRESENTATION (Team Work)
All students working on a particular issue will post a presentation for the entire class to review.
In presenting your issue, it is important to present both sides. In addition, you should provide
information from your individual articles and your field work.
WRITTEN REPORT (Individual Work)
Reports should include the following sections and will generally be 3-5 pages long:
A. Article Review
1.​ Citation of article using APA style, including retrieval information.
2.​ Summary (Concise but thorough coverage of main points)
3.​ Evaluation (your analysis of the strengths, weaknesses and applicability of
the article)
B. Discussion of Field Work
1. Description of what you did or who you interviewed, including a copy of
your questions or survey.
2. Analysis/discussion of your results and how they relate to the issue.
C. Reflection on Your Issue - Based on your reading and field work, what are your own,
personal thoughts on this issue?
GRADING
The issue presentation and paper comprise 20% of each student’s final grade. The criteria that
will be used in determining grades are the following:
Written Report

Remember to cite your articles using APA formatting. For detailed tutorials and information on
APA format, see associated items on Blackboard or visit the Stevenson Library resources. Here’s
a quick example:
Author Last Name, Initial of First Name. (Year of publication). Title of the article. Title of
Periodical, Volume number(Issue number), page numbers. Retrieved from Name of database.
doi:10##########
So it would look like this:

Smith, A. B. & Jones, C. (2011). How not to plagiarize: A simple guide. The
Journal of Citations, 8(2), 26-34. Retrieved from imaginary database.
NOTE: the title of the article is NOT capitalized, but the name of the journal is. Only last names
of the authors are spelled out and there are no titles (Dr. or Ph.D). Follow punctuation exactly.
Even if an article is retrieved off of the internet, the basic citation information must be included.

COUNSELING & HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT
CHS 201 - HUMAN SERVICES and Social Policy
Team Research Project
Community Needs Assessment

PREPARATION
●​ Choose a special population group with a potential human services need. Examples include but are
not limited to: College students and involvement in healthy activities, the elderly and keeping active
socially, abused or neglected children, college students and substance abuse, the chronically
homeless, the social needs of disabled youth or reintegration of incarcerated. Your group has some
flexibility with choosing the topic. Get approval from your instructor on your special population
before you begin.
●​ Individually, begin your research by completing the Annotated Bibliography assignment. This will
provide you with some background information as you and your team move forward with your
Community Needs Assessment.
CONDUCTING THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT
1. Create a Needs Assessment Action Plan:
●​ Formulate Needs Assessment Questions. What do you want to learn about this special
population? Meet with your group to develop questions that will guide your inquiry into the
needs of this community of people. If you were going to create a program or advocate for
changes in public policy for this special population, what information would you first need to
know about this special population?
●​ Review existing data. What do you already know about the community? Possible sources
include your annotated bibliography and previous field experiences. This is an opportunity
for team members to share the information with each other.
●​ Determine what information you still need to know and how you will gather that information.
You will complete the Community Needs Assessment Action Plan with your group.
2. Collect new data. Each team member is responsible for a conducting field work activity. The field work
should be part of the Community Needs Assessment Action Plan. Examples of field work can include an
additional field experience with targeted questions or phone interviews of several service providers, a
survey or interview of community members or other stakeholders. Create the data collection instrument
(the survey or interview questions) and collect the data.
.
3. Analyze your Data. Meet with your team to formulate ideas about the key findings you have learned
about your community. Be sure to identify your source through in-text citations.
4. Report Your Findings. Each team will be allotted 20-30 minutes to present their findings to the class.
These findings should provide an in-depth discussion of the needs, strengths and resources of this special
population. In addition to the findings, this presentation should include an overview of your Community
Needs Assessment Action Plan and your data collection methods.
GROUP DELIVERABLES

1.​ Community Needs Assessment Action Plan
2.​ Class presentation
INDIVIDUAL DELIVERALBLES
1.​ Field Work
2.​ Reflection Paper
INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION PAPER
You will write a 2-3 page paper (double spaced) reflecting on your work in the community needs
assessment. This paper should include the following:
1.​ Field Work. Describe your field work. Describe the results of your field work. How did your field
work contribute to the overall community needs assessment? Include a copy of the data collection
tool you created.
2.​ Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of you community needs assessment. If time and resources
was no barrier, how would you improve the community needs assessment?
3.​ The group process. Working in a group can be very rewarding and highly productive. Group work
is not just about lightening the load by dividing up responsibilities; when done well the
collaborative process can be much more than the sum of its parts. At the same time, when groups
do not function well, the group process can be very challenging. Reflect on how well your team
functioned. Provide examples. What was your role in the group process- i.e., what did you do to
add to help the team function collaboratively? What conflicts did your group have and how did
you work through these problems?

perspectives with which you may be uncomfortable or disagree. The class readings, assignments
and discussions will require you to think critically about various aspects of diversity and may
challenge some of your values and beliefs. It is important to treat each other with respect, to
listen to other points of view, and to question others in an appropriate manner. Information
shared in class is confidential.
WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS
All written assignments must be typewritten. Handwritten assignments will not be accepted
unless prior approval has been provided by the instructor. All written assignments will be
submitted in the Blackboard site.

approval of the instructor. Student must provide a documented valid excuse explaining why they
could not complete the assignment. Examples of documented valid excuses that will be
considered are those involving illness, family emergencies, and catastrophic incidents, all of
which can be verified through documentation and directly affect the involved student. If you
miss an assignment without an acceptable documented valid excuse, you will earn a grade
of Zero.
Grades will be lowered 10% for each 24 hours (including weekends and holidays) the
assignment is late.

Submission of Assignments or Projects: All written assignments must be submitted in Times New Roman, font size
12 and double-spaced. All assignments should be uploaded in Blackboard unless other instructions are provided.

responsible for the material covered during scheduled classes. Grades will be based on demonstrated achievement of the
objectives of the course, not on attendance in class as such. Students who stop attending and fail to officially withdraw
from a class will be given a grade of "FX" which calculates as an "F" in the GPA.
Course-Specific Attendance

Participation
Students are expected to participate in all classes and to arrive promptly. Whenever a student is absent, it is
the student’s responsibility to obtain lecture notes and handouts for that class session. While a student is not
required to attend all classes, a student cannot actively participate unless s/he is present for most classes

Sample Country Report

South Korea, also named Republic of Korea, is located in East Asia on the Southern half of the
Korean Peninsula “jutting out from the far east of the Asian land mass into the Yellow Sea”(Geography of
South Korea). It’s northern boundary is marked by the Korean DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) which also
forms the Southern border of North Korea, also called the Democratic People Republic of Korea
(Geography of South Korea). South Korea is surrounded by three seas: The yellow sea to the West, the
East China Sea to the South, and the Sea of Japan to the East (Geography of South Korea). South Korea’s
capital city, Seoul (Geography of South Korea), was home to over 10 million people in 2018 (The
Statistic of Seoul, 2018), making up for 19% of South Korea’s total population of over 51 million people
(South Korea Population (LIVE)).

South Korea’s history officially begins after World War II, when Japanese occupation
ends with Soviet troops occupying the North, while U.S troops occupied the South in 1945, with
the formal establishment of South Korea in 1948 (South Korea: History). Each power, both
North and South Korea, accepted Japan’s surrender in order to bring stability to their nation

(History of South Korea). Japan’s surrender however, marked the beginning of Soviet and U.S
trusteeship over North and South Korea (History of South Korea). The United States troops
landed at Incheon in 1945 and established a military government shortly after (History of South
Korea). After WWII, chaos plagued the country, which emphasized the mark that Japanese
colonization left in both North and South Korea, as well as the unpreparedness of US’s military
government due to the drastic differences in culture (History of South Korea). The People’s
Republic of Korea (Korea as a whole country, before division) was short lived, but it was
developed after negotiation with Japanese invaders (History of South Korea). The People’s
Republic of Korea was deemed invalid by the United States in the South and in 1945, the US
returned the Provisional government the status of private citizens followed by the development
of the Korean Advisory Council (History of South Korea).

During the first republic, after the establishment of South Korea, popular elections
elected Syngman Rhee as the first president; this was followed by the Soviet Union establishing
North Korea, or the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea under Kim II-Sung (History of

South Korea). Throughout the year, the new government continued to develop itself, and the
president was to be elected by a National Assembly (History of South Korea). In late 1948, the
United Nations only recognized the republic of Korea as the sole legal government of Korea
(History of South Korea). Land was also redistributed by the U.S and South Korea that was
originally held by the Japanese colonial government, companies, and colonists; even Koreans
with large amounts of land were told to give up most of their land which resulted in a new class
of family proprietors (History of South Korea). Although Rhee was accepted, his cabinet was
not, and a party was created in hopes of removing this cabinet, which led to a regrouping of
Rhee’s faction into the soon to be known Liberal Party (History of South Korea). Rhee’s goal
was to align South Korea’s government closely to the United States’ government, which meant
he was against both North Korea and Japan. Relations with Japan or North Korea achieved little
progress, which resulted in Korean forces invading South Korea in 1950 (named the Korean
War) and was ended by the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953 (History of South Korea).
After the agreement, there was political turmoil under the leadership of Rhee which eventually
caused a revolt due to his want of cementing control over the government and need for more
power (History of South Korea). The non-violent protests throughout the country against Rhee’s
leadership, eventually led to his resignation in 1960 (History of South Korea).

During the second republic, It was the first and only time that South Korea utilized a
cabinet system instead of a presidential system (History of South Korea). In 1960, Yun Posun
won election and Chang Myon became the prime minister and head of government (History of
South Korea). The second republic mainly revolved around the growth of student unions, as
union activity grew rapidly (History of South Korea). Chang carried out purges of military and
police officials who were involved in anti-democratic activities or any sort of corruption, which
resulted in more than 2,200 government officials and 4,000 police officers being killed (History
of South Korea). During this time, the government also considered reducing the size of the
military substantially, and the economic status of the country was not in such a great shape, so a
5-year plan was developed in hopes of stabilizing the economy (History of South Korea).

During the third republic, Park Chung Hee (Major general of the military in South Korea
during the second republic) ran again and won 51.4% votes, and he eventually won the 1971
election (History of South Korea). During the third republic, South Korea began taking a role in
international relations and their relations with Japan slowly stabilized, with an agreement ratified
in 1965 (History of South Korea). The nation continued its ties with the United States, as it
continued to take U.S aid. Korea joined the Vietnam war, sending 300,000 soldiers to fight
alongside the United States and South Vietnamese troops (History of South Korea). Their
economy grew rapidly, as they used aid from both Japan and the United States to expert
businesses (History of South Korea). In 1971, Park declared a national emergency and in 1972,
he dissolved the National Assemble and announced plans to “eliminate the popular election of
the president” (History of South Korea).

During the fourth republic, Park developed a new constitution which gave him control over
parliament (History of South Korea). This journey towards power eventually led to his
assassination in 1979 and marked the beginning of the fifth republic (History of South Korea).
After his assassination, protests mostly composed of university students and labor unions against
authoritarian rule, reached an all time high, and a confrontation between these students, union
members, and armed forces took place in the city of Gwangju (History of South Korea). This
confrontation turned into a riot that lasted 9 days (History of South Korea). Many union
members and college students were killed during this riot, which outraged the public and
consolidated the support of democracy which paved way to the first democratic elections in 1987
(History of South Korea).

Ever since 1987, South Korea has been a democratic community, and managed to create
one of the most vibrant “democratic communities in the world” (Government of South Korea).
Its government now divides into three branches: the executive, judicial, and legislative branches,
even though some ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions (Government

of South Korea). Local governments also contain executive and legislative bodies of their own
(Government of South Korea). The president heads the executive branch and the constitution
permits the president to serve a 5-year term (Government of South Korea). The president’s
serves as the head of the government, the head of the state, and the commander in chief who has
the power to declare war as well as declare a state of national emergency (Government of South
Korea). The National Assembly has the authority to impeach the president under suspicions of
wrong doing by both the president or by cabinet-level officials (Government of South Korea).
The prime minister acts as a vice-president would in the United States (Government of South
Korea). If the president becomes incapacitated, then the prime minister takes control of the state
(Government of South Korea).

Despite South Korea being a relatively new nation, its economy has been able to grow
exponentially. Since the 1950s, South Korea’s GDP (gross domestic product) has continuously
increased and it has not had a substantial amount of decrease; how is this possible? After the war,
South Korea was very poor (Mincheva, 2017). The first attempt at economic growth was the
“idea that import substitution would lead to self-sufficiency of the economy” (Mincheva, 2017).

The government increased tariffs on imports substantially and importers received special permits
to import certain products (Mincheva, 2017). This policy allowed businessmen to get rich,
however it failed due to the average growth rate still being very low (Mincheva, 2017). Until the
1960, more than 2/3rds of South Korea’s annual income was financed by the United States, and
for a while South Korea depended on the aid that the United States was supplying (Mincheva,
2017). During the second period, Chung Hee introduced economic intervention (Mincheva,
2017), and the country’s economic takeoff was mostly due to rapid industrialization under the
direction of the military government (Seth, 2017). During this time, South Korea’s economy
grew rapidly (Seth, 2017). Today, South Korea’s economy is the fourth largest economy in Asia,
making it also the 11th largest one in the world, often famous for its exponential rise out of
nothing (Economy and Business Opportunities from South Korea). It is a mixed economy, with
its domination revolving around family owned businesses (Economy and Business Opportunities
from South Korea).

More than 50% of South Korea’s population confess to belong in some sort of religious

affiliation (Religion in Korea). The country is one of the few countries in which all popular
religions coexist in peace, as its affiliations spread among Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism,
Shamanism and Islam (Religion in Korea). Some citizens even follow a religion, but also utilize
traditions of another religion; for example, there is a substantial number of citizens who
categorize themselves as Christians, but often follow traditions and practices belonging to
Confucianism (Religion in Korea). Even new religions have emerged within the South Korean
community, such as Cheondogyo (Religion of the Heavenly Way), which inspired and had a
leading role in the Independence movement against Japanese colonizers (Religion in Korea).
This religion combines elements of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Shamanism, and Roman

Catholicism (Britannica, 1998) and the religion and its customs, focus on leading people into the
path of enlightenment (Cheondogyo).

Because South Korea has a mixture of religions, there are many Public Holidays that
pertain to these different religions. They have many holidays known to the United States, such as
Christmas Day, but they also have Hangeul day, which marks the invention of the Korean
alphabet in 1446, or Chuseok which is a bit like Korean Thanksgiving day (South Korea Public
Holidays 2019). When it comes to traditions and customs, due to the country being home to
many religions, cultures often differ from household to household, and often are we able to see
the intertwine of the different cultures and how it works together in order to shape the everyday
life of a South Korea household (Byung-Sun Oh, 1997). In other words, South Korean supports
religious freedom, and this can be clearly seen in the diversity of the country as a whole
(Byung-Sun Oh, 1997).

Although progression, industrialization and democratization has revolutionized a
woman’s role in South Korean society, traditional gender roles are highly favored (South Korea).
House work is regarded as woman’s work even when a woman has a profession outside of the
home (South Korea). Women in the workforce often also get paid less than men, and men
overrepresent the workforce as well as the population within their political system (South
Korea). The law also calls for equality of all citizens, regardless of gender; but that is not the
norm, and these norms (gender role ideologies) often complicate things in multiple ways (South
Korea). Women are allowed to do things such as run for presidency or for high power positions,
but because of the norm of them being submissive towards men in social settings, it makes it
quite difficult for women to actually run and succeed (South Korea); although in private, men
often leave decision making to their wives (South Korea). This norm however, does not mean
that women do not often fight to change it (South Korea). There are women’s movement whose
goals are to protect women’s rights as well as improve their status (South Korea). In response to
this activism, men organized the first National Men’s Association due to reverse sexism, and

they enacted to prevent violence and sexual harassment that favor women and fight to abolish
exclusively male duties such as military service (South Korea).

When it comes to family structure, family background and educational level are
important considerations when in search of a partner (South Korea). This is where the old and
the new may collide, as some individuals have love marriages, but some may meet their spouse
through arranged meetings by parents, relatives, friends, or matchmakers (South Korea).
Marriage in itself is seen as a right of passage that comes with its own social status as well, and it
is seen as a union of their families as well in order to ensure the continuation of the husband’s
family line (South Korea). Remarriages are rare, and in some instances, in more traditional
locales, remarriages of widows are not allowed and remarriages after a divorce are difficult
(South Korea). The South Korean familial household mostly consists of two-generation
households, three-generation households are more traditional, but that in itself is fading and only
14.7% of the total population belonged to a three-generation household in 1995 (South Korea).
When it comes to inheritance, it was nationally known for the eldest son to receive a larger

portion of the parent’s inheritance because it is more common for the eldest son to be held
against higher standards and be given most of the responsibility (South Korea). In 1989 however,
after a revision of the Family Law, it re-stated that family inheritance must be divided “equally
among sons and daughters (South Korea).

Children are thought to be indebted to their parents and this debt lies in the idea of filial
duty (“Treating parents respectfully at all times, taking care of them in their old age, mourning
them at proper funerals, and performing ceremonies for them after their deaths”) (The Value and
Meaning of the Korean Family). The “children’s debt to their parents” goes further along,
entailing that maintaining the family line is a must as well (The Value and Meaning of the
Korean Family). Traditional South Korean families include children eventually leaving the home
but living close by (The Value and Meaning of the Korean Family). Young children are
“indulged” and are not disciplined until they are older (The Value and Meaning of the Korean
Family). Parents also began separating girls and boys and trained children to be respectful to
their elders, not being respectful to elders resulting in punishment (The Value and Meaning of the
Korean Family). Girls were seen as outsiders that will eventually leave the family and,

traditionally, many of them were not taught to read or to write (The Value and Meaning of the
Korean Family). She was taught that her place in the family was inferior to that of her male
siblings, and that of her father (The Value and Meaning of the Korean Family). In today’s South
Korean household however due to democracy and urbanization, both girls and boys are entitled
to an education and are both treated more equally in the household, although it is expected for
the girls to take on more household tasks and chores when they get older.

Contrary to traditional norms, according to research, the elderly is not properly taken care
of in South Korea, and it is an ongoing problem (Smith, 2018). It is very common for the elderly
to not be taken care of by their children, as they are “too busy taking care of their own children”
(Smith, 2018). The elderly often say that they do not want to burden their children, and even go
as far as to say they do not want to be supported by their children (Smith, 2018). The elderly
often live in tiny rooms and they often admit to being uncomfortable with their situation but
claim that it is something they have to live with (Smith, 2018). Almost half of the elderly

population of South Korea live in poverty (Smith, 2018). This situation is mostly due to South
Korean’s ageing society “whose hard graft transformed South Korea into one of the strongest
economies, but who have not reaped the financial benefits in later life” (Smith, 2018). Elderly
who live alone often experience nursing problems, economic and psychological anxieties, and
loneliness (Smith, 2018). As a matter of fact, South Korea’s high suicide rate is largely due to the
high suicide rates in the elderly population specifically (Smith, 2018). Most of the elderly
population also cannot afford to retire, and often have to rely on jobs in order to not become
homeless, but it has also been proven rather difficult for the elderly to obtain jobs in the first
place, which result in many of them not being able to afford a place to live at all (Smith, 2018).

In regard to the LGBTQ+ community, South Korea, especially within the Christian population of
South Korea, is primarily conservative (Manzella, 2018). There have never been official laws
that prohibit sex marriage or homosexual sex, but being gay, lesbian, or transgender is still a
cultural taboo; most of the homosexual population in South Korea is still closeted (Manzella,
2018). Also, although there have not been laws specifically prohibiting same-sex marriage, this
type of marriage is not recognized by the government and the population does not have laws

against discrimination (Manzella, 2018). South Koreans who identify as LGBTQ+ are unable to
adopt children or serve in the military (Manzella, 2018). Through censorship, the government
has blocked same-sex dating apps and Korean Christian organizations often fuel campaigns that
spread the message of marriage strictly being between a man and a woman (Manzella, 2018).
Specifically with transgender individuals, only when they surgically change their sex can they
officially change their sex from a male to a female or a female to a male (Manzella, 2018).
Despite all of these bumps on the road for South Korea’s LGBTQ+ population, more than half of
South Korean’s overall population supports same-sex marriage (Manzella, 2018). Korea is home
to an annual pride event that occurs annually, as well as a Queer Culture Festival (although it had
to go to court due to police banning this event) (Manzella, 2018). The progress is slow, it is an
ongoing battle, but the LGBTQ+ community is is slowly but surely gaining momentum is South
Korea.

South Korea is strong in many ways; however, the mental health field is not one of its

strengths. In Korea, “there is no such thing as mental health” ('In Korea, there is no mental health':

Barriers to treatment, 2017). As previously stated, suicide rates in South Korea are relatively high,

second highest in the world, and this can be partly due to citizen’s hesitation in seeking help in
the first place ('In Korea, there is no mental health': Barriers to treatment, 2017). In fact, when one
expresses themselves as having a mental issue, they are seen as weak-minded ('In Korea, there is
no mental health': Barriers to treatment, 2017). In the Christian community, when one has a mental

health issue, it is often seen as someone having lack of faith in Christ ('In Korea, there is no mental
health': Barriers to treatment, 2017). Reasons for suicide can be anywhere from lack of conformity

in the young population, to poverty and loneliness in the elderly population ('In Korea, there is no
mental health': Barriers to treatment, 2017). Barriers of actual treatment are partly due to the cultural

norm of lack of trust in strangers, as well as family reputation ('In Korea, there is no mental health':
Barriers to treatment, 2017). A strange response to this suicide epidemic are “Death Experience”

schools, where suicidal teens are “taught to appreciate life again”, by showing them what it is
like to be dead (Mailonline, 2015).

It is typical of South Korean citizens to want to remain a purely Korean nation and due to
this, it has only been recently that South Korea has begun to test its waters on immigration by
hiring temporary foreign workers, as well as giving undocumented immigrants temporary
permits (Park, 2015). At the end of 2015, there were a total of 1.5 registered foreign nationals,
which is an incredible 235% increase over the less than 500,000 registered foreign individuals in
2003 (Park, 2015). Due to this process being relatively new, there is not much that can be said
over the matter except wait and see. Korean immigrants to the United States however, has seen a
dramatical increase since the 1960s, with just a tiny fraction being from North Korea (O’Connor
& Batalova, 2019). Contemporary Korean immigrants tend to be of high socioeconomic standing
compared to other immigrant groups that reside in the United States (O’Connor & Batalova,
2019). South Korean students have been “among the three largest groups of international
students enrolled in U.S higher education institutions” (O’Connor & Batalova, 2019). As of 2017
however, the Korean immigrant population has decreased by 37,000 since 2010 (O’Connor &
Batalova, 2019).

The “strongest strength” that South Korea has by far, is perhaps the sole reason for its
other, overall strengths as well: their economy. Backtrack to 50 years ago, South Korea was
poorer than Bolivia and Zimbabwe. Fast-forward to today, and it is richer than New Zealand and
Spain (Noland, 2014). In 1996, the country joined the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development (a club of “rich industrialized countries”) (Noland, 2014). Their economy, for
the past 50 years, has increased at an average of 7% annually with the exception of just 3 years,
and according to Forbes, in 2004 South Korea surpassed One Trillion Dollars (Noland, 2014).
Their strong economy is the main reason of its technological advancements being a strength as
well. Its capital, Seoul, is ranked as the world’s leading digital city and tech capital of the world.
South Korea is also one of the leading global research nations in the world, especially in the
world of industrial research (Science & Technology in Korea). Due to their overall wealth, the
government is fast in funding these research programs which allow them to progress as they do.

Aside from the challenges with the elderly population, the challenges when it comes to
the lack of help for those suffering from mental illnesses, and the challenges that those within the
LGBTQ community face every day, perhaps the biggest challenge that South Korea has, is one
that began since Korea’s Separation: Tension between North and South Korea. For nearly seven
decades, tension between the two sides has been relatively active and high, and although tensions
have been beginning to decline between the two countries, the border that keeps both sides from
going into war (again) is very thin. In 2010, tensions rose between North and South Korea, when
South Korea refused to listen to North Korea’s warning when told to stop military drilling in
between the two countries (Fertoli, 2010). This caused North Korea to bomb the area, which
killed at least four people and injured a dozen others (Fertoli, 2010). Since then, Moon Kae-in
(current South Korean president) and Kim Jong-un (leader of North Korea) have been trying to
ease the tension, and their goal has been to reach an ultimate status of peace between the two
countries (Panda, 2018); but differences in leading styles and in customs, may prove that to be a
very difficult challenge to accomplish. If achieved however, this can be marvelous for both
populations (Panda, 2018). With time, this challenge has the potential to eventually become a
strength (if they reach a status of peace).

​

Although South Korea is fond, as well as welcoming when it comes to differing religions

and customs, when it comes to diversity, they have a bit of a challenge with cultural competence.
In fact many South Koreans have complained of the “growing intolerance” towards foreigners,
going as far as to having “Korean-only” bars, which sparked outrage in the society (Meinecke,
2016). This discriminatory behavior is still occurring in the country because there are no
anti-discriminatory laws in place to protect foreigners from discrimination itself, and efforts to
change this have failed (Meinecke, 2016). Ethno-national and linguistic homogeneity have been
the norm for South Korea for many years, and it is going to be rather difficult to change that.
They have always, ever since Korea was founded 5,000 years ago, been a “one race”, “one blood
country”, and they have taken great pride in that fact (Park, 2017). The government however, is
trying to be more tolerant and more exploratory to foreigners in recent years however, as they
began exploring the water on immigration primarily focusing on temporary workers (Park,
2017).

Immigrant Interview Paper
CHS 220 Spring 2019
200 points
The purpose of this paper is for you to learn about the immigrant experience from a specific
individual’s perspective. The individual can be a family member but does not have to be. It does
not matter whether the person is a documented or undocumented immigrant. The person you
select must have been old enough at the time s/he came to this country to answer the
questions meaningfully. It is important that you give the person a chance to talk about their
experience and not continuously ask questions.
I am providing some sample questions. You do not have to ask these exact questions but you
must cover each of the topics. It is better to ask open-ended questions in order to obtain
information, but at times, it will be necessary to ask questions, which require one or two word
answers. Be sure that the person is willing to answer all the different topics that you need to
cover.
After you complete your interview, you will write a paper (either traditional format or questions
followed by answers and double-spaced) which addresses the questions asked and then includes
a reflection by you that should cover 1)what you learned from the interview, 2)what
surprised you and 3)how your views might have changed based on the interview.
Suggested Questions
What country did you come from?
Describe it.
What are the customs and traditions of your country?
How is family defined?
What are the expectations of children? How are they treated?
What was your occupation in your country of origin? Describe it.
What is the religion of your home country?
Describe the roles of men and women in your country.
How are the elderly treated?
What kind of prejudice, discrimination or oppression did you experience in your country?
What was your reason for leaving your country?
How did you feel leaving your country?
What language(s) did you speak? What language(s) do you speak in the United States? If more
than one language is spoken in the US, where or when is each language spoken?
How many of your family members came with you? How did this affect your experience?
How many family members did you have in the United States prior to coming? How did this
impact on your experience?
What occupation do you practice in the United States? If there was a change, please talk about
why your occupation changed.
How is your mode of dress similar or different from what you wore in your native country?
What foods did you eat in your native country? How is your diet in the United States similar or
different?
What religion do you practice in the United States?
What type of prejudice, discrimination or oppression have you experienced in the United States?

How is where you live now (housing as well as location) similar or different from your country
of origin?
What changes have you made since coming to the United States?
Describe the hardest part of your adjustment to the United States. What has been the easiest
part of your adjustment?
What do you think is important for Americans to know about the immigration experience?
Be sure to complete your reflection, which is described in the directions.

Sample Response Paper

We live in a modern world, and yet, some of our beliefs and practices regarding race

reveal that our world may not be as developed as we would like. Looking at Baltimore City
specifically, Freddie Gray is the perfect example that racism still exists in our society today.
Racial profiling is common enough in our society that the term “Driving While Black” or DWB

is used to address being pulled over by police officers for no apparent reason. Robin DiAngelo,
through her presentation “Deconstructing White Privilege,” discusses racism in our society
through her “white experience”; while informative about bias, racism and white superiority, she
fails to address what we, as a society or as individuals, can do outside of recognition of racism.
​

DiAngelo opens with how our country was founded on race and unequal power, she uses

an example that could be understood by the masses explaining how men gave women the right to
vote. She claims that this practice continues through “group prejudice backed by institutional
power.” Her claim is easily seen through school and neighborhood segregation, she notes that
bad neighborhoods are considered neighborhoods with people of color. What she fails to address
about the school and neighborhood segregation is why this occurs; lower class neighborhoods
are generally filled with people of color because of the cycle of poverty, statistics reveal that
people of color are paid less than their white counterparts as well as the fact that women of color
are paid even less then men of color. White supremacy is the dominant factor in these examples.
While I feel that she does address neighborhood segregation she fails to address the cause
(poverty) and without, there is a loss in the value of the information she presents.
​

While talking about being white, DiAngelo mentions that everyone has their own

experience and promoting the concept of universalism fails in allowing people to feel that their
experience is real. Furthermore, the concept of individualism is also knocked by claiming that it
is perpetuated by the dominant group (white). My main issue with both of her statements is that
is appears that she does not have a clear answer as to what stance we should have (individualism
vs universalism). When I was going through primary school I lived in a predominantly white
suburb and often had one or two black people in school. As I went on to high school, I was
accepted into a magnet program that was in a neighborhood people often felt was unsafe and

impoverished. When I told my friends and certain family members I was told to be careful
because I might get stabbed. The school was no longer mostly white and in fact was dominated
by people of color. Through that experience I was able to see that the neighborhood was no more
dangerous than the other neighborhoods, but rather people just viewed it as such because the
dominant group was no longer white. Weed was extremely prevalent in the area, yet the “nice,
white school” had many students overdosing on heroin.
​

DiAngelo is correct in saying we all have our own experience but how can I tell who has

had what experience and how to assess a situation properly. Which opens our eyes to the
good/bad binary mentioned throughout the video, the bad or racist people often have specific
characteristics associated with them and she says this binary prevents us from seeing people in a
different light. But in personal experience, often this binary is true. My grandfather is an old
white, republican, trump supporter and often stands behind his very similar racist beliefs, beliefs
that extend beyond race to other ways that people live their lives. Not to say that I do not care
about my grandfather but I vehemently disagree with him and often feel like I am in a losing
battle when trying to discuss race. Implicit bias is rampant in our society and while not always
correct, certain people do fit into that binary, often stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason. Not
to say that we should not give people a chance but rather to address that implicit bias is created
through experience. The good bad binary, while maybe should be considered as not totally
accurate can often reign true.
Robin DiAngelo opens a dialogue about the rampant and obvious racism that occurs in
our society but misses the mark when it comes to clarifying meaning. When the video ends, the
viewer is left with more questions about their implicit bias and how to assess themselves and
others. The presentation opens a can of worms, failing to discuss a solution as to how this can be

fixed in our society. The apparent answer seems to be that it will take multiple generations before
racism is truly less of a problem than it is now. But again, DiAngelo misses the mark on a full
explanation of the purpose outside of recognizing the problem.

Presentation (100 points) Weeks of April 29 & May 6
Students will be presenting their research proposals in class. They will demonstrate their grasp of the research process, share
insights on their topics from the research, speculate on the prospective contribution their research could make, highlight the
problems/limitations they anticipate and how they would overcome them. It is an opportunity for students to engage each other,
availing themselves the benefit of the knowledge produced by their individual research effort. This assignment is worth 100
points, the same as a test grade.
Regular class attendance and participation are necessary to pass and/or do well in this and indeed all courses. Students are
encouraged to be punctual and regular to class as class discussions are likely to draw on materials not covered by the assigned
readings. Various in-class assignments are worth 10 points.
If class is canceled due to the weather or other unforeseen reason, the lesson will be posted on Blackboard. It is the student’s
responsibility to check Blackboard and complete any posted assignments!
GUIDELINES and DUE DATES FOR THE RESEARCH PROPOSAL
Final Research Proposal = 200 Points

Assignment I: Topic Feb 15
To do research, in this case, write a research proposal, you need a topic – a general area of social study or
a social issue. A research topic is typically broad so allows the researcher, you, to develop it through the
steps of the research process, throughout the semester. Research is a rigorous, time and energy
consuming endeavor. As a result, topic selection should be done thoughtfully, paying utmost attention to
your interests. When you select a topic that interests you, it lightens the weight of the rigor involved in
doing research and you’re likely to complete the project.
Assignment II: Problem Statement and Research Questions Feb 20
Statement of Problem

First, explain what your general topic area is, touching on its different aspects, narrowing articulately to
your specific interest which, typically, is an aspect of your general topic area. Assuming your general
topic area is Domestic Violence, you offer a broad understanding of it, touching on its different aspects,
ending with the aspect that interests you most, the one you’ll study, say, Child Abuse. Next, explain why
your topic is worth studying – spell out the practical significance of your study – are there practical
problems about it that need to be understood or solved? Does the study have theoretical significance?
Research Questions
Use your topic to pose a question. This is your research question. For instance, using the Child Abuse
example, if the researcher identified ‘age of child’ as a factor, one may make a research question: Does
exposure to child abuse vary by the age of the child? Always pose the research question in such a way
that when you answer, it explains your topic or what happens to your topic.
Assignment III: Operationalization & Hypothesizing Feb 27
In this assignment, you think about your concepts and use them in making your research hypotheses.
Using teen pregnancy as an example:
Teenagers from 1-parent families are more likely than those from 2-parent families to be pregnant. OR
Teenage pregnancy will occur more among those from 1-parent families than those from 2-parent
families.
Assignment IV: Research Design April 3
This assignment should be completed as detailed below.
Topic: State your topic.
Data Collection:
Identify the study population, the population to whom your findings would apply. Explain how you
would collect data for your proposed study, identifying your technique by name. State how you would
select your sample, the sample selection technique you would use, how you would meet selection
requirements, if any, and your sample size.
Questionnaire
Construct a questionnaire, listing the questions/statements you will use to elicit responses to measure your
variables and test your hypotheses. Use closed-ended questions and describe how you would compute the
responses.
.
Assignment V: Literature Review DRAFT 1 March 25, DRAFT 2 April 15
The best way to can develop writing skills in writing literature reviews is to read others' literature reviews.
The write-up should reveal what is known about the topic generally, theoretically, and empirically, and the
variables in your proposal. Your reader should have a fair knowledge of what others have said or found
about your topic from the write-up. Organize the literature review by themes or subthemes. It’s a good
idea to use your variables as themes or subthemes. WHY IS THIS TOPIC RELEVANT/
IMPORTANT/NECESSARY? Remember to Use at least eight (8) primary sources.
Assignment VI: Conclusion (Limitations, Implications, Impact Assessment) and References April 24
Conclude your proposal by summarizing it, restating the necessity of your study, and speculating on the
potential methodological and/or analytic problems you would encounter if you were to carry out this
research and how you would overcome them. Conclude by speculating on the potential contribution your
research would make to our understanding of your topic if it were carried out. Include any insights this
project afforded you on your chosen topic. On a sheet of paper titled 'References', provide the details of

all the materials cited throughout the project. Use the APA style to organize and present all your
references.
REPORTS WILL BE PRESENTED IN CLASS AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER
Students will be presenting their research reports in class. They will demonstrate their grasp of the process and
share insights on their topics. This is an opportunity for students to engage each other, availing themselves the
benefit of the knowledge produced by their individual research effort.
Your grade for this presentation will equal 100 points, an exam grade.

GROUP COUNSELING (CHS 315/515)
PROCESS ANALYSIS PAPER
Paper
Apply your textbooks, as well as a minimum of 4 additional references, to your
experience in group. Your paper must address the stages of group, techniques and
practice, and specific group process concepts to the evolution of your individual
group. Do a process commentary on your group from both a leader’s and
member’s perspective. Apply your research on group process to an analysis of
your own experience in group. Conceptualize the group process, rather than give a
report of events. Incorporate your own experience of key themes in a way that
demonstrates your understanding of the readings by focusing on such points as the
following:
-​

What did you learn about yourself through this process?

-​

Focus on the qualities about yourself that might either enhance or detract
from your effectiveness as a group leader.

-​

Express concretely what this class taught you about being a group
member and a group leader, as well as what you learned about how
groups function, the stages of a group, and specific techniques to
facilitate the group process.

-​

What factors contribute to a working and productive group?

-​

When do groups get stuck, and how do they get “unstuck”?

-​

How can we best address resistance and anxiety in groups? What about
conflict?

-​

What have you learned in this class that you can apply to groups that you
will lead in the future?

-​

Describe your group and explain how your group did or did not fit the
characteristics described in the readings. ​

Seeking Resources Project (Grant Proposal)
Administration of Human Resources: 340/540
​
You will select an organization which provides services to clients for which you have
concern/passion. This organization can be one in which you are doing your internship, an
organization where you plan to do your practicum, one where you have worked or volunteered in
the past, the organization you created as a team in this class, or one where you would like to
work one day.
​
Overall, your goal is to develop a grant proposal to support one initiative within the
organization you selected. You will research/write a grant proposal, no more than 4 single
spaced pages, which address the initiative you choose. You will use the following format for
your proposal:
●​ Statement of Need:
1.​ Defines the problem and explains precisely what your organization wants to
change.
2.​ Focus on the target population you want to help. Here is where you do a
review of the literature.
a.​ Provide current data from a variety of sources such as national studies,
surveys, news media articles.
b.​ Simply interpret any data you obtain rather than just putting it in the
section.
c.​ Address what is the problem, what is the cause, why does it continue to
exist?
d.​ Use APA style when documenting resources
Reference page & in-text cites
●​ Goals (at least 1) These are broad, global descriptions of something you want to
accomplish over a period of time. They are idealistic and timeless and should inspire us.
●​ Objectives (Impact objectives) at least 3. These are clear, attainable and measurable and
time limited. Focus on results and begin with an action verb.
●​ Activities and Tasks: For each objective, what will be done, by whom and when.
●​ How you will evaluate – simple statement for each objective.

●​ A simple budget (Sample attached)
●​ Appendices:
1.​ Your mission statement
2.​ Your Impact chart
3.​ Your resume
4.​ Letters of personal endorsement or support of donating resources. (not included as
part of the 4 pages)
You will also present an overview of this proposal in class. Each student will have no
more than 5 minutes to present. Your audience will be your grant providers and you will
try to convey the importance of your request.
Grades will be based on:
Clarity of written organization: How is each section above addressed?
Research provided and use of APA style
Technical detail – spelling, grammar
Is there a compelling case for your request?
Oral presentation – is it clear and does it make sense??
Papers are due on the date of the presentation:
You will have time to work on this project in class – please bring your research
information for the Statement of Need to class. This class time can be used to ask
questions, seek reaction from others in the class, and clarify issues regarding the project.
It will be a working session.

demonstrated achievement of the objectives of the course, not on attendance in class as such. Students who stop
attending and fail to officially withdraw from a class will be given a grade of "FX" which calculates as an "F" in the
GPA.
Course-Specific Attendance
Attendance at your field placement is critical to the successful completion of this course. You are required to complete
90 hours of field placement. Up to 10% (nine hours) may be forgiven due to unscheduled agency closures such as due to
inclement weather or serious illnesses or other emergencies. Approval of missed time for serious illnesses or
emergencies will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and will only be approved with appropriate documentation.
Attendance at internship class meetings is expected. Punctuality and meaningful participation is one means for your instructor to
assess your professionalism and fitness for the profession

Family Dynamics and Interventions (CHS 430-02 & 03)
FALL 2018

Assignment 1 - Family of Origin Project
General instructions: This assignment requires you to apply the concept and theories we will
study to your family of origin. In order to complete this assignment you will need to conduct at
least two interviews of family members. You may interview parents, grandparents, siblings,
aunts, uncles, or cousins. You will cite these interviews in your bibliography. Please discuss
confidentiality with your interviewees, get permission to use the interview material, and use only
initials when identifying participants. You may include pieces of transcript in your paper only
with expressed permission of your interviewee.
Instructions for paper:
Section one: (1 page) Produce a detailed genogram of your family of origin covering at least
three (3) generations (going back to your grandparents). The genogram may be hand drawn or
you can use a genogram software program. A number of programs are available to download for
free. (One good program is available at www.genopro.com but many other are also available,
enter “free genogram software” on Google for an extensive list.) You may use an extra large
sheet of paper if you wish.
Section two: (4 to 10 pages) In narrative form, write a complete systemic analysis of your
family of origin, referring back to the genogram. Issues you should cover and include:
1.​ _____ Boundaries (within the family as well as between the family and the world);
2.​
_____ Hierarchies, subsystems, & alliances within the family (also discuss
triangulation, power & cutoffs);
3.​
_____ Roles Played by Family Members (Scapegoat, Hero, Comic, Lost Child,
Enabler, Violent or Angry One)
4.​ _____ Sibling Cohesion;
5.​ _____ Rules (spoken and unspoken);
6.​ _____ Significant Losses & Family Adaptation;
7.​ _____ Family Life Cycle;
8.​ _____ Family Myths, Secrets, & Lies;
9.​ _____ Role & Effect of Birth Order;
10.​_____ Transgenerational Patterns & Issues
You must give specific behavioral examples to back up your analysis. Don’t just say, for
example, that there were strong intergenerational boundaries. Discuss the specific
behaviors that demonstrated that those boundaries existed.
Section three: (4 to 8 pages) Select a theme of your choice to research and apply to your family
of origin. You may create your own theme or select from the following list:

1. The effects of alcoholism or addiction on the family.
2. Blended and step family issues.
3. Single-parent family.
4. The effects of violence or abuse.
5. Family secrets.
6. Legacies of loss.
7. The role of ritual in the family.
8. Coping with death or illness in the family.
9. Cultural issues in the family.
10. The effects of mental or physical illness on the family.
11. Trans-generational transmission of gender roles.
12. Family stories and the construction of meaning.
13. Models of marriage.
14. Enmeshment and disengagement.
15. Emotional milieu within the family.
In completing this section you will need to cite at least three scholarly articles and/or books
that address the theme you are discussing. You will also need to give specific behavioral
examples to illustrate your theme as it plays out in your family of origin.
Section four: (One page) Attach a bibliography citing all references using APA reference style.
List all interviews, including person interviewed, date of interview, length of interview and mode
of interview (phone, in person, email).
This paper is due October 1, 2013. Papers may be handed in before that date but no late papers
will be accepted. Paper must be double-spaced, using 12 point font. Hard copies ONLY. No
e-mailed papers.
Grading:
Writing conventions (spelling, grammar, organization) 15 points
Genogram (completeness, neatness, clarity) 5 points
Systemic analysis (completeness, depth, grasp of concepts) 30 points
Selected theme (depth, originality, insight, quality analysis) 45 points
Bibliography (APA style, documented interviews) 5 points
Total possible 100 points

Extra Credit: Students may volunteer to present their Family of Origin Projects in class.
Students who do this will receive 5 points of extra credit on this assignment.
It is understood that this assignment can be emotionally difficult for some students in that
it might require focus on issues they are not prepared to address, or they may feel
uncomfortable in exposing personal information to the instructor. If you feel you cannot
complete this assignment please make an appointment to talk with the instructor and an
alternative assignment will be arranged.

CHS 430 Assignment 2 - Group Project
You will be assigned to “families”. These families will be the subjects of the role plays we will do in
class. In addition, your “family” will be your workgroup for the completion of this assignment. Your
“family” will be assigned an “issue” or issues that bring you to therapy and will also be assigned a theory
from which to approach this issue.
Class time will be allotted to help you prepare, but you will need to do considerable work and
communication outside of class in order to complete this assignment.
Part one: Meet as a group.
1. Assign roles, deciding who will be the parents, the children, etc. Decide on the age and gender of the
children. 2. Who is/are the identified patient(s)?
3. Describe the relationships between family members.
4. Develop an identity and history for each family member.
5. Decide how the identified problem will play out in the family.
Keep notes of your decisions.
Part two: In addition to a family “issue” you will be assigned a particular theory. You will need to
research how your assigned issue would be addressed within this theory. For example if your issue was
“alcoholism within the family” and your assigned theory was “solution-focused” you would need to
research how a solution-focused family therapist would address alcoholism in the family. Your group will
then do a demonstration of this
approach to this problem by role-playing a family session for the class. This presentation should be no
more than 30 minutes. For purposes of this demonstration, one of your group members will need to step
out of his or her usual family role in order to be “the therapist”.
Part three: As part of the presentation your group will do a brief (30 minute maximum) didactic
presentation on how your theory would address the techniques that were demonstrated and the theoretical
constructs involved. Be prepared to answer questions. You will want to provide the class with a coherent,
well organized summary of your assigned theory highlighting terms, concepts, and key points associated
with the theory. Dates for these presentations will coincide with the schedule of readings on each theory.
Grading:
Part one (Family Description) 25 points
Part two (Family Therapy Demonstration) 25 points
Part three (Presentation on Your Assigned Theory) 25 points
Part four (Individual Participation) as graded by fellow group members & instructor. 25 points
Total possible: 100 points
Major Family Therapy Approaches​
Object Relations. (Framo and Scharff).​
Experiential. (Satir and Whitaker).​
Transgenerational. (Bowen).​
Structural. (Minuchin).​
Strategic. (Haley).​
Cognitive-Behavioral. (Beck and Ellis).​
Social Constructionist. (deShazer and Anderson).​
Narrative. (Michael White).​
​

1. Object Relations. (Framo and Scharff).Satisfying relationship with some “object” (e.g., parent) is a
fundamental need. Helps client gain insight into early relationships (objects from past) and how they
affect current relationships enabling individual development and fulfilling relationships.​
​
2. Experiential. (Satir and Whitaker).Troubled families need a “growth experience” derived from an
intimate interpersonal experience (therapy). By being real (authentic) and self-disclosing, families learn to
be more honest, more expressive, and better able to achieve personal and interpersonal growth. For Satir,
building self-esteem and learning to communicate openly are essential goals. Whitaker suggested that
helping family members probe their own world of symbolic meanings frees them to activate innate
growth processes.
​
3. Transgenerational. (Bowen).Thinking, feeling, and behaving are tied to the family system. The
individual’s problems arise and are maintained by relationship connections. Problems are passed from one
generation to the next. Fusion = most vulnerable; Differentiation of self = least vulnerable.​
​
4. Structural. (Minuchin). Focuses on how families are organized and what rules govern their
transactions. Pays attention to rules, roles, alignments, coalitions, and boundaries. Challenges rigid,
repetitive transactions within a family, helping to “unfreeze” them and allow family reorganization.​
​
5. Strategic. (Haley).Assigns tasks to get family to change aspects of the system that maintain problematic
behavior. Paradoxical interventions are employed to force clients to abandon symptoms. NOT interested
in providing insight.​
​
6. Cognitive-Behavioral. (Beck and Ellis).Maladaptive behaviors can be extinguished as the contingencies
of reinforcement are altered. Focuses on communication skills, parent training skills, cognitive
restructuring, etc.​
​
7. Social Constructionist. (deShazer and Anderson).Suggests that each of our perceptions is not an exact
duplication of the world, rather, a point of view seen through the limiting lens of our assumptions about
people. Therapy involves jointly constructing new options that change past accounts and allow new
alternatives.​
​
8. Narrative. (Michael White).Our sense of reality is organized and maintained through stories.​
Families present with negative, dead-end stories. The goal is to explore alternative stories, make new
assumptions, and open up new possibilities by re-authoring stories.​

CHS 441 Seminar in Human Services
Issue Paper and Presentation
For your issue presentation, choose an issue or challenge that you have been facing at your site this
semester. It doesn't necessarily have to be a problem, but something that you have noticed or had to
deal with. You can get some ideas from your textbook, particularly the sections in chapter 8 about
"Encountering Challenges" starting on p. 224 and "Issues with the Site" on p. 237. You will be expected
to write a 3-4 page paper that describes the issue and possible resolutions. Do some research about the
issue and include information from this additional reading in your paper (be sure to use appropriate APA
format to cite your sources). In class, you will give a 10-15 minute presentation to the group about the
issue. It does not need to be a formal presentation with PowerPoint slides, just be prepared to describe
the issue and how you have handled it to the class.

relevant catalog at http://www.stevenson.edu/academics/catalog/ .
Course Requirements:
​

Exams:
The purpose of these exams is to assess your understanding of and ability to apply the material in this class. Some
questions will focus on assessing your knowledge and others will assess how well you can apply the information

you’ve learned in class to realistic situations. There will be three non-cumulative exams in this class. Each exam is
worth 100 points, and can consist of a combination of multiple choice and short answer questions.
Exam dates: All exams are on-line using Blackboard.
Standards for Written Assignments
APA style is the recommended format. Please, remember to properly footnote/reference ideas that are not your
own. Give the full reference of the research article (author, year, title, journal name, volume, pages) using APA
style. Help with references can be found at the Purdue Online Writing Lab
(http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/) and at the American Psychological Association website
(http://www.apastyle.org/index.aspx).
All assignments need to be double-spaced, 12 point Times New Roman font, with 1 inch margins on all sides.
Please include a cover page and a reference page, with in-text citations (where applicable). Points may be
deducted if this format is not followed. In general, you should work on content in your first draft and then
consider organization and style as you move through the drafting and writing process and, of course, careful
proofreading and editing.
Homework Assignments:
1.​ Reading Anticipation Guides (RA): Before reading each chapter, you will be required to complete the RAG for
that chapter. You will need to turn it in at the beginning of the class where we are scheduled to start
discussing that chapter. Please fill this out by hand as opposed to typing it on the computer. DUE: at the
beginning of each class when topic will be discussed.
2.​ NOBA Module Quiz: In most of the on-line modules there is a mastery quiz. The mastery approach gives you
the opportunity to practice retrieving the information from the module over a series of retests. The more you
do the better you are likely to do on the exam. For this class you must complete the quiz with 20 items AT
LEAST ONCE, before the beginning of the next chapter. You may complete the quiz as many time as you like,
and each mastery level to which you progress will be used as extra credit for the calculation of your grade.
3.​ Article Summary: Read, discuss, and summarize an assigned research article. The article will be posted on
Blackboard. DUE as noted in assignment
4.​ Experiential Learning Assignment: Participate/attend a psychology and/or mental health related event
outside of the classroom, or a university event that you can relate to this course material.. I will make
frequent announcements of campus events that meet the criteria for this requirement. Acceptable events will
include: participating in a research study or psychology experiment, being a volunteer for psychological
testing, attending a lecture by a mental health professional, attending a Psychology Club, Psi Chi, or
Psychology Department event, attending a Wellness Center mental health event, or a Psychology/Mental
Health related presentation off campus. Off-campus events need the instructor’s approval in order to receive
credit for this requirement. You will write a brief report relating the activity to the course content. DUE: the
class after your participation
5.​ Data Collection Projects: Participate in the data collection for 2 small research projects completed outside of
class. You will write a brief report for each project and be prepared to discuss them in class. DUE: TBA
6.​ Research Participation: Participate in 5 research studies conducted by SU psychology students either in
person or online. DUE: upon completion.
7.​ Happiness Assignment: After reading articles relating to the topic of happiness, you will write a paper
detailing your responses to specific questions. DUE: As part of the final exam
8.​ Student Showcase: Attend the Psychology Student Showcase and write a summary of your experience.

Participation & Professionalism: The basic principle is that I expect respectful behavior in this class. Your
participation grade will be based on your professionalism, engagement, and contribution in large group and small
group discussions in class as well as large group, small group, and individual in-class activities. There will be no
opportunities to make up participation points. You must be present (both physically and mentally) in class in order to
receive participation points. We are all colleagues and collaborators in learning. Therefore, we should all treat each
other with the consideration and respect of professionals. Professionalism will count towards your grade. Therefore,
you will lose points for any non-professional activities.
These include all disruptive and disrespectful behaviors including:
texting during class;
using your laptop or tablet for ANYTHING other than taking notes during class;
tardiness or leaving class early;
missing appointments with class colleagues including faculty;
failing to work collaboratively and respectfully with peers;

Final Grade

COURSE POLICIES
Unscheduled University Closings
If there is an unscheduled university closing on the day that an assignment is due, the assignment
deadline will remain unchanged if it was to be submitted through Blackboard (assuming Blackboard is
operable). If a quiz is administered in class on the day of an unscheduled closing, the quiz will be
postponed until the next class meeting.
School Closings
In the event of a school closing, the SU Alert System will send text messages to smartphones indicating
the nature of the closing and further instructions, as necessary.

Communication
I prefer to talk to you in person about any ideas or issues you may have, so please schedule an
appointment to meet with me! If you miss class, please get notes from a classmate and then meet with
me to discuss anything you don’t understand from those notes. If you need to email me, allow 48 hours
for a response (although I’ll do my best to respond as soon as possible). I will often correspond with you
through campus e-mail or Blackboard announcements. Please become familiar with how to log on to
both systems and check your e-mail regularly. Class changes and updates will be posted in Blackboard
and sent to your Stevenson e-mail address.
Classroom Policies:
We are all colleagues and collaborators in learning. Therefore, we should all treat each other with the
consideration and respect of professionals. Since attendance is not required, if you can’t abide by these
guidelines, just work from home.

We are all adults here, act like it.
No texting or using cell phones during class;
No using your laptop or tablet for ANYTHING other than taking notes during class;
Be here on time and only leave early if you must.
You should work collaboratively and respectfully with peers;
Don’t talk during class except to contribute to the discussion. You may be asked to leave if
this behavior persists.

​
Submission of Assignments or Projects:
Standards for Grading Written Assignments
APA style is the recommended format. Please, remember to properly footnote/reference ideas that
are not your own. Give the full reference of the research article (author, year, title, journal name,
volume, pages) using APA style. Help with references can be found at the Perdue Online Writing Lab
(http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/) and at the American Psychological Association
website (http://www.apastyle.org/index.aspx).
Missed Assignment
Meeting deadline is an important skill. You will generally get a more positive appraisal if you meet the
deadlines, meaning there is generally a way to regain lost credits.. To miss or extended an assignment,
you should send me an e-mail letting me know, if possible 24 hours in advance. In all cases, the decision
to allow a student to make up a test or assignment, as well as the time period for any extension is left to
my discretion.
There are several situations that are accepted as no penalty:
1)​ hospitalization or illness whose symptomatology has been documented and judged by your professor
as preventing sufficient test preparation or your ability to sit for a test;
2) a death or serious illness in the family; or
3) court appearances

University Policy on Attendance
Each student is responsible for his or her own class attendance and regular attendance is expected. Every
student is responsible for the material covered or the skills exercised during scheduled classes. Grades will be
based on demonstrated achievement of the objectives of the course, not on attendance in class as such.
Students who stop attending and fail to officially withdraw from a class will be given a grade of "FX" which
calculates as an "F" in the GPA.
Course-Specific Attendance
This class works best when you are here. The Lab component in particular is accomplished in real time and
much of the activity can be completed in the assigned time. Missing the Lab will almost certainly delay your
progress. The TA’s are available to help you in that time, and can assist at other times at their discretion. I
generally know when you are here and when you are not.
I will monitor your attendance in accordance with mandates from the Stevenson University Registrar.
While you will not earn a grade for attendance, failure to attend class regularly may cause you to miss
assignments, pertinent information, and opportunities for participation. As a result, it is to your benefit
to attend class regularly. If you continually fail to attend class, I will contact you to discuss your
attendance.

Grading Standards:
The above Stevenson grading system will be used. Because you have all semester to earn points, I do NOT negotiate
grades at the end of the semester. Furthermore, I will NOT offer any extra credit assignment. I would be happy to talk
to you about ways to improve your grade throughout the semester!
Continuance and Progression Policies, if applicable: N/A

Course Requirements:
Exams (50% of your total grade) The purpose of these exams is to assess your understanding of and
ability to apply the material in this class. Some questions will focus on assessing your knowledge and
others will assess how well you can apply the information you have learned in class to realistic
situations. There will be four non-cumulative exams in this class. Each exam is worth 125 points and
will consist of a combination of multiple choice and short answer questions. The final exam (i.e., Exam
4) will be the same format and worth the same number of points as the three midterm exams. Note that
the final exam is not cumulative. Very selectively, permission may be given to miss an exam and take a
makeup exam due to extenuating circumstances. Evidence (e.g., doctor’s note or other verification) will
be required (but may not be sufficient) in order to get permission to make up an exam. Students who
are requesting a makeup exam must submit the request form to the instructor (available on Blackboard).
If you miss an exam and are not permitted a makeup exam, you will receive a 0 on that exam.
​
Reflection Papers (30% of your total grade) The reflection papers give you an opportunity to
connect your own experience of human development to the material you are learning in this class. You
will be submitting four reflection papers for this course. All reflections should be submitted through
Blackboard by the time and date specified in the assignment. Each paper is worth 75 points. Late
papers will lose 7.5 points for each 24-hour period. For example, if a paper is due at 11:59pm on
Wednesday and you do not submit it until 12:15pm on Friday, the maximum possible points you can
earn for that paper will be 75 – (7.5 x 2) = 60. Each reflection paper should be about 2-3 pages long,
double-spaced written with Times New Roman font. Specific prompts will be discussed in class and
then posted on the course website at least a week prior to the due date. Please cite your instructor (M.
Wong, personal communication, Insert date here) and/or the textbook for in-text citations. A reference
is not necessary for these papers. If you are unfamiliar with APA style, visit
http://www.apastyle.org/learn/tutorials/basics-tutorial.aspx and pay special attention to slides 13 to 25.
Be sure to visit Blackboard for more information.
​
Weekly In-Class Quizzes (10% of your total grade) In order to ensure that you are keeping up with
the readings, understanding the course material, and prepared to discuss topics in class, there will be
in-class quizzes related to the readings and other material covered in class (see class schedule). Makeup
quizzes will only be given for students with extenuating circumstances (e.g., illnesses with proper
documentation) and students will need to fill out a makeup request form available on Blackboard. Each
quiz is worth 10 points. These quizzes will include a mix of questions related to topics from the most
recent class meetings and assigned readings.
​
Participation & Professionalism (10% of your total grade) Your participation grade will be based on
your professionalism, engagement, and contribution in large group and small group discussions and
activities in class. There will be no opportunities to make up participation points. You must be present
(both physically and mentally) in class in order to receive participation points. You will be given some
early feedback regarding your participation and professionalism before the middle of the semester. We
are all colleagues and collaborators in learning. Therefore, we should all treat each other with the
consideration and respect of professionals. Therefore, you will lose points for any non-professional
activities. These include all disruptive and disrespectful behaviors including: using your computer
device (e.g., laptop, cell phone, tablet, etc.) without approval from instructor (also see Policies on p.4 of

326
the syllabus); tardiness or leaving class early; missing appointments with faculty (or peers); failing to
work collaboratively and respectfully with peers; participating in “extracurricular” conversations
during class.

COURSE POLICIES
Policies: Late policy: All late assignments will lose 10% of its worth for each 24-hour period. Please note: No
Computer Device Allowed in Class. No computer device (e.g., laptop, tablet, cell phone, etc.) will be allowed
in class except with permission from the instructor. A study published in Psychological Science (one of the
most prestigious journals in the field of Psychology) by Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) found that using
computers to take notes would actually hinder learning. In contrast, taking notes via longhand (i.e., traditional
pen and paper) would encourage deeper processing, thus better understanding of the materials. Not to
mention, students who use computer device during class tend to go off-task very frequently, which is really
disrespectful to the instructor, and distracting for everyone else in class. Students who are requesting to use a
computer device in class must complete a request form available on Blackboard.
Classroom Policies: I prefer to talk to you in person about any ideas or issues you may have, so please visit
my office hours or schedule an appointment to meet with me! If you miss class, please get notes from a
classmate and then meet with me to discuss anything you don’t understand from those notes. I will often
correspond with you through campus email or Blackboard announcements. Please become familiar with how
to log on to both systems and check your email regularly. Class changes and updates will be posted in
Blackboard and sent to your Stevenson email address.
Submission of Assignments or Projects: Exams and Quizzes are in class, unless communicated otherwise.
Reflection papers are due to Blackboard.
Attendance
Each student is responsible for his or her own class attendance and regular attendance is expected. Every
student is responsible for the material covered or the skills exercised during scheduled classes. Grades will
be based on demonstrated achievement of the objectives of the course, not on attendance in class as such.
Students who stop attending and fail to officially withdraw from a class will be given a grade of "FX" which
calculates as an "F" in the GPA.
Course-Specific Attendance
I expect you to come to class. Missing class regularly may cause you to miss quizzes, in-class activities, and pertinent
information. If you continually fail to attend class, I will contact you to discuss your attendance.

Course Description:

Introduces building blocks of knowledge in the discipline of sociology, a discipline that examines how humans
interact and how their interactions are influenced by social forces. The course covers core concepts and theoretical
perspectives in sociology, how sociological research is done, and offers the student critical insight into the social
processes and institutions that affect people’s lives. ​ ​
This is a SEE-certified Social Sciences 3cr course.
Instructional Methods Used in this Course:

How would you best succeed in this course? You can best succeed by engaging in active and intentional
reading/learning of the assigned materials and coming to class ready to actively participate in the class discussions by
making comments, asking and answering questions. This means you will read the materials for each class in
advance. To make everyone’s involvement possible, the class will be split into small groups to generate
questions/comments on the week’s topic for class discussion. In this way, all class members will have an opportunity
to actively participate, talk, so we can all break the monotony of hearing just my voice. Please note that if the class
gets too quiet, I might call on class members to share their thoughts and I hope those so asked won’t consider it as
“picking” on them.

Students are responsible for ensuring that they take these tests as scheduled, using reliable internet connection. The
fourth is the final exam which will be in-class. A make-up for a missed test will be arranged only if the reasons for
missing the test are officially tenable, and appropriate documentation is provided. These tests make up 50% of the
course points.
Socio-autobiography Paper​ ​
(Due: April 12)
We understand something the most when we either experience it or are able to relate to it, one way or another. This
assignment requires students to explore how sociology relates to them, using their life experiences. It is an
opportunity for them to demonstrate their understanding of key sociological vocabulary words (sociological
concepts). So each student will write a 3-4 page paper, a socio-autobiography, typed in normal font, 2-line spaced,
narrating a life experience within any of the themes listed below. This must be a coherent story of your experience,
within any one of the themes listed below. These concepts must flow naturally with the story and not be forced into
the narrative to make the tally. The key things I’m looking for in this paper are:
i)​
the use, appropriately, of 15 sociology concepts, typed in bold font throughout the paper: you do not
need to define these concepts in your paper. Note that the task here is to use sociology concepts NOT
theory. Do NOT use any theory in this paper. Each concept should be typed in bold only once even
if you use it several times in your paper.
ii)​
an appropriate topic for the paper, within any of the listed themes, to use these concepts. Note that
“socio-autobiography” is the title of this assignment. It cannot be used as title for your paper.
iii)​
evidence of ability to use/apply the sociological imagination to your story.
Some possible themes include the following:
​ a)​
work (your status and role(s) as an employee)
​ b)​
school (the transition to high school or college)
​ c)​
changing one’s identity or claiming a new identity
d)​
the process of becoming a member of a group or learning to do something new
​ e)​
creating and sustaining intimate/romantic relationships
Many other themes may be developed. Please consult me if you have a suggestion for a theme that does
not appear in this list.
This paper will be graded based on the appropriate use of the selected sociology concepts, appropriate title
for the paper, organization of the essay, clarity of thought, coherence of the story, use of proper grammar,
and use of the sociological imagination. Make sure to proofread your paper before submission. Spelling
and grammatical mistakes will be penalized with point deduction. See the rubric attached.
Students are required to include (write) the pledge at the top (beginning) of this paper.
This paper is worth 20% of the course points.

Identifying Sociology Concepts in a Text​ (due: April 26)
In this assignment, students will read an assigned material and identify the sociology concepts (not
theories) in the text they read. These concepts may be used explicitly by the author(s), they may be
described but not explicitly named or they may be detected as underlying ideas of the text, not necessarily
mentioned explicitly or even described. The material for this assignment is “The polygamous town facing
genetic disaster” – on Blackboard. In your paper, the concepts shall be numbered numerically, you will
reproduce the text carrying the concept (the entire sentence, not parts of it) and provide the number of
the page where it can be found. Highlight the concept (in yellow), if it appears in the text or highlight the
portion of the sentence that describes or carries the idea of the concept, or the entire sentence if that is the
case. Do not list a concept more than once. Derivatives of a concept will not be counted e.g. if you list
polygyny, polygynous will not be counted as another concept. See the Blackboard for the example of how
this paper shall be formatted.
There are more than 15 sociology concepts in this text, used either explicitly, described but not directly
mentioned or as underlying ideas of the text. In this assignment, you will identify 15 of these concepts.
Note: the only texts in this paper are those from the article. You are not allowed to write anything of your
own in this paper.
This paper is worth 15% of the course points.
Group Project/Presentation
Working in small groups of 5-6, students will pick a topic from the following, research it and present in
class: Right to Marry; Immigration Reform; Mass Shootings; Healthcare for all Americans (Obamacare);
Voter ID Laws; Death Penalty; and “Black Lives Matter”. Group members are expected to exercise
discretion on the specific direction they wish to take their topic. They should aim at sharing significant
new information on their topic with their colleagues.
Groups will research their chosen topics and present their findings in class. All members of the group
must participate in the research, compilation or organization of materials, and presentation of their
findings. Group members who fail to participate in any aspect of this project: research, compilation, and
presentation, shall not be entitled to the points for this assignment. Groups may select a topic outside of
this list but such topic shall be cleared with me. No written report is required.
Groups may use available teaching aids eg PowerPoint – video clips shall not be longer than 3 minutes
and will have to be approved by me.
Groups are required to display the pledge in PowerPoint before commencing their presentations.
The group presentation is 5% of the course points.
Discussion Questions
The class will be split into small groups. Each group will be assigned one or more class topics. The
group reads the assigned materials for the topic, and other relevant sources, and comes to class, on the
date of the topic, with 5 questions or comments on their assigned topic, for the class to discuss. These
should not be one-liners so must be framed in a way that generates discussion among class members, not
yes or no responses. These questions must be generated by the group members, not copied from their
sources. Group members should review their questions and make all necessary corrections before

337
submission. Spelling and grammatical mistakes will be penalized. The discussion questions are worth
5% of the course points.

Video Review​
-​ due May 3 (Optional: only as Extra-Credit)
Students who so desire may write a 2-3 page review of the documentary Generation M: Misogyny in
Media and Culture. Your opening paragraph summarily captures the video’s theme, explains it and states
the subthemes under which it is discussed in the video. Dedicate each subsequent paragraph to each of
the subthemes: identify the subtheme and summarize how the video explains or discusses it ensuring that
the key points of a subtheme are sufficiently reflected in your summary. In your final/concluding
paragraph, comment critically on the documentary with reference specifically to the video’s theme,
highlighting any insights this video affords you on the general topic of gender inequality. Make sure to
correct all spelling and grammatical mistakes in your paper before submission. Spelling and grammatical
mistakes will be penalized with point deduction.
Students who do this assignment are required to include (write) the pledge at the top (beginning) of this
paper.
Group Discussion (GD) ​
-​
due May 3 (Optional: only as Extra-Credit)
The class will break up into small groups of 5-6 to discuss the article “Lesbians blurring the
boundaries….” The discussion will be conducted using a discussion guide I will provide. No written
report is required. However, students may submit a 2-3 page report answering the questions in the
discussion guide, on the due date, for extra-credit points. Make sure to number your answers
correspondingly. To use this assignment for extra-credit, students must participate in the in-class group
discussion. This paper must be written individually.
Students who do this assignment are required to include (write) the pledge at the top (beginning) of this
paper.
Extra-Credit Assignment
Two extra-credit assignments are provided in this syllabus: the video review and the group discussion
papers. Students who are interested may do any one of them. In addition, students may attend a HaSS
event and report on it for extra-credit. I will announce the HaSS events in class (and on Blackboard) and
provide details of topic, venue and time. This will be a 2-3 page, double-line spaced, report explaining
the topic of the event, relates it to concepts covered in class or in the textbook, and highlights what new
things you learnt from the event. Each extra-credit assignment is worth 4% points. All extra-credit
papers are due on May 3.

COURSE POLICIES
Policies:

The deadlines for all assignments must be observed. Late submissions will not be accepted except when due to
circumstances that are officially tenable and backed by relevant documentation, or the student has my prior consent to
be late.
Classroom and Studio Policies:

338
Students are allowed to use laptops in this class, strictly for notetaking. Cellphones may be brought to this class but
they must be on mute.

Submission of Assignments or Projects:

All tests, with the exception of the final exam, and written assignments shall be done on or submitted
through the Blackboard. Written assignments submitted through the Blackboard must be in Word doc,
typed in 2-line spacing, in Times New Roman font size 12, stay within the page limit as specified. Do not
email assignments to me or submit assignments in class. The deadlines for all assignments shall be
observed. Late submissions will not be accepted except when due to circumstances that are officially
tenable and backed by relevant documentation, or the student has my prior consent to be late. The
preferred referencing style for all written assignments is the APA style. Make sure to read the
instructions/guidelines for every assignment before you do it. Failure to follow instructions for an
assignment might lead to rejection of the paper or points deduction. All assignments submitted through
the Blackboard are screened through SafeAssign. Students are required to include (write) the pledge at the
top of every written assignment. The final exam shall be in-class.
Attendance
Each student is responsible for his or her own class attendance and regular attendance is expected. Every student is
responsible for the material covered or the skills exercised during scheduled classes. Grades will be based on
demonstrated achievement of the objectives of the course, not on attendance in class as such. Students who stop
attending and fail to officially withdraw from a class will be given a grade of "FX" which calculates as an "F" in the
GPA.
Course-Specific Attendance
Regular and punctual attendance of classes is required because class discussions typically draw on materials and sources
outside of the assigned readings. Class discussions offer an invaluable opportunity for students to be active participants
in the learning process. In fact, course-points are allotted to class participation and you cannot earn these points if you
don’t attend classes. Overall, you cannot pass this class if you do not attend classes.
