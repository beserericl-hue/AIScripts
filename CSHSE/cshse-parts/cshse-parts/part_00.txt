A. Required Introductory Material: General Introduction to the Program
1.

Specify the degree(s) offered for which accreditation is being sought.
Bachelor’s Degree

2.

Describe the institution.
Table of Contents

a.​ Describe the organizational structure, whether state or private, age of institution, brief
history, and so on.
Response: Stevenson University is a private, independent, coeducational, liberal arts university
with approximately 4,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The university was formerly
known as Villa Julie College, which was founded in 1947 as a two-year preparatory school for
women. Villa Julie became co-educational in 1972 and a four-year college in 1984. In 2004 the
first residential facilities were opened on the Owings Mills campus and in 2008 the college
changed its name to Stevenson University.
Stevenson is located in Baltimore County, Maryland. Stevenson was initially established on the
Greenspring campus but purchased the Owings Mills campus in 2002, and all recent
development has happened in that area. All human services courses are offered on the Owings
Mills campus, where the department moved in 2018. The Owings Mills campus houses all
residential facilities and most athletic and student activity facilities. The Owings Mills North
area was created by the purchase and renovation of the former Shire Pharmaceuticals site and
houses the graphic design and art facilities, as well as the Manning Academic Center. A new
library was constructed on the North Campus and opened in 2024. Offices for the Counseling
& Human Services program are in this building. CHS classes are taught in the MAC. A new
theatre is also under construction on the North Campus. The Greenspring campus no longer has
any undergraduate academic programs, although the PsyD program and administrative offices
are still located there.

b.​ Describe the institutional context of the Program. For example, include organization charts
and structure, goals, and objectives. What levels of degree are offered by the institution? For
large programs with multiple sites, organizational charts are extremely helpful to the
readers.
Table of Contents

Response: The academic structure of the University includes seven schools. Stevenson
University Online administers all graduate programs (master’s level; M.S. degree) and online
instruction targeted to adult learners. Undergraduate programs (bachelor’s level; B.S and B.A.
degrees) are organized under the Beverly K. Fine School of the Sciences, Brown School of
Business and Leadership, Sandra R. Berman School of Nursing and Health Professions, School
of Design, School of Education, and School of Humanities and Social Sciences. The
Counseling & Human Services Department is in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences
(HaSS). There are 7 departments in HaSS: Psychology, Legal Studies, Criminal Justice,
Interdisciplinary Studies, History and Humanities (the department includes philosophy and
religion courses), English Language and Literature, and Counseling & Human Services.
Organizational charts for the University and for Academic Affairs are located in the Appendix.
The University embraces the motto, “Imagine your future. Design your career” and the four
core values of community, learning, integrity and excellence. See the University Mission,
Vision & Values.

a.​ Briefly describe the strengths of the Program and any attributes that make the Program
unique.
Response: The Counseling & Human Services Program at Stevenson University is
characterized by an emphasis on field experience to develop effective human service
professionals. All Counseling & Human Services majors spend a minimum of 450 hours in
field experiences. Students are placed in agencies related to their specific interests, such as
mental health facilities, hospitals, addiction treatment centers, schools and centers for children
with developmental and behavioral problems, facilities for the elderly, government agencies,
and a variety of other sites. These valuable experiences give students the opportunity to apply
the knowledge they have gained in the program and to develop their skills as confident and
competent human services professionals.
Additional strengths of the program are:
●​ The knowledgeable and dedicated faculty, both the three full-time instructors and the
numerous adjunct instructors, who all bring significant expertise to the classroom and
work collaboratively to strengthen the program.
●​ A diverse student population who are from a wide variety of backgrounds, but are all
committed to helping others. (See pictures of recent graduating classes.)
●​ A supportive and engaged Advisory Board who understands both our students’ needs
and the demands of the human services profession. They are effective advocates for our
program, our students, and Stevenson University.
●​ A comprehensive and meaningful evaluation process that collects and analyzes
information on student performance, both in the classroom and in the field, and uses
that information to examine program processes and curriculum.
b.​ Describe institutional course requirements for all students and explain how they prepare
students for study in the human services program. For example, describe general education
or liberal arts requirements of the institution.
Response: The University requires students to take a general education core that includes two
courses in writing/literature (plus two additional writing intensive (WI) courses, one at the 200
level and one at the 300 level; this requirement is fulfilled by required courses in the program),
one communication course (usually public speaking), three courses in mathematics and science
(statistics is required and biology is recommended), one course in fine arts, and four courses in
the humanities (history, literature, religion, foreign language and philosophy). The general
education core courses prepare students to communicate effectively, think deeply and critically
about problems, and understand the complex social and cultural context of issues. A solid base
in the liberal arts allows students to better understand the problems and perspectives of their
clients and to be more effective helpers. See University learning goals.

c.​ Include any other background information that may be pertinent such as action plans for
identified problem areas, changing enrollment patterns, marketing strategies, or institutional
or curricular restructuring.
Response: Enrollment in the Counseling & Human Services Program declined over the past ten
years, but over the past 5 years has been relatively stable with about 50 majors. The program is
well-established and continues to fulfill an important role in the University. Marketing
strategies are centralized in the admissions area of the university, but a departmental Instagram
page has been established and a centrally located bulletin board for the department highlights
activities and graduates. There has been significant expansion university-wide with the addition
of athletic fields on the East Campus and a new academic hub library where CHS offices are
located. The CHS Program Coordinator, John Rosicky, developed a network of trails in the
wooded areas between campuses. Programmatically, we have reduced the number of required
credits in the CHS program (see program changes in 4c below) to further improve the flexibility
of the program and make it more enticing as a transfer destination. The final practicum is still 9
credit hours, but the number of hours has been reduced to 360 hours to alleviate student stress.
With the 90 hour internship we still exceed the required number of experience hours for the
program.
4.

Interim Report and Review and Reaccreditations only
Table of Contents
a.​ Include a copy of the letter from the Vice President of Accreditation (VPA) sent at the time
of the prior accreditation notifying the Program of the disposition of the application for
accreditation.
Response: The Human Services Program was initially granted accreditation by CSHSE in
October of 2004. It was granted reaccreditation based on a self-study in October of 2009, with a
full site visit in 2014, and again based on a self-study in 2019.
See reaccreditation letter in the Appendix.

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

b.​ Describe how each condition in the VPA letter has been addressed.
Response: The four requirements for the current reaccreditation were all addressed. More
details are given under the appropriate Specifications, but briefly the requirements were:
●​ Standard 11.c Historical and current legislation affecting service delivery
Include more emphasis on social policy, both present issues as well as how legislation has
shaped existing services (or lack of).
-​ The title of the introductory course for the program CHS 201 was changed from
“Introduction to Human Services” to “Human Services and Social Policy” in 2018 along
with the addition of additional emphasis on social policy issues (see current syllabus)
●​ Standard 12.g Processes to effect social change through advocacy work at all levels of
society including community development, community and grass-roots organizing, and
local and global activism
Include advocacy and social change for marginalized populations. Such advocacy can occur in
the context of a human service agency but also by assisting and empowering individuals and
community groups/organizations/churches to effectively advocate for resources and services
that address their needs and concerns.
-​ In addition to the changes to CHS 201 mentioned about, an assignment was added to that
course on conducting an assessment of community needs and proposing steps to address
those needs, including advocacy and community organizing (not just doing “for”). This
introduction is more thoroughly expanded in CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, in
which students write a grant proposal to address community needs with a fully developed
rationale for the proposed strategy.
●​ Standard 14.g Knowledge, theory, and skills are included, analyzed, and applied in the
curriculum in regard to: performing and elementary community needs assessment:
Include a greater emphasis in the program on community development in contrast to the strong
emphasis on service delivery within human services agencies.
-​ As mentioned above, a major assignment in the introductory course was added requiring
students to visit a community/agency, assess needs, and report on ways to strength that
community.
●​ Standard 14.h Knowledge, theory, and skills are included, analyzed, and applied in the
curriculum in regard to conducting a basic program evaluation:
Include more direct instruction on designing and conducting a program evaluation and on
understanding research, in order to effectively identify, understand, and utilize evidence based
practices.
-​ This issue is covered thoroughly in CHS 340 Administration of Human Services and in
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing. Conducting a program evaluation is part of
strategic program planning and evaluation, as well as evidence-based management, both of
which are units in the administration course. In addition, the narratives of program
proposals developed in the research methods course must contain detailed plans for
program evaluation.

c.​ Describe any major program changes since the prior accreditation.
Response: The program is fundamentally the same and the purpose, mission and objectives
have not changed. The curriculum has been modified slightly as described below. The Sheppard
Pratt certificate (a 5-course sequence of CHS courses offered to SP employees at their campus)
has been on hold since the fourth cohort graduated in December of 2021. Detailed program
analyses were conducted at faculty retreats in 2021 and 2022. One of our fulltime faculty
members, Tom Swisher, retired in December of 2022 and the decrease from 4 to 3 faculty
members resulted in the “department” becoming a “program”.

d.​ Describe any major curriculum changes since the prior accreditation.
Response:
Summary of Changes to the Counseling & Human Services Program:
●​ The course number of Human Services and Social Policy (introductory course in the
first semester of the program) was changed from CHS 201 to CHS 105 in 2020.
●​ Social Justice was added as a topic for CHS 250 Topics in Human Services. (2021)
The following changes were all implemented in 2023 following a departmental retreat in
December of 2022.
●​ CHS 270 Psychopharmacology and Addictions will no longer be required of all
students, but is still required in the Addictions and Mental Health Track and is a
recommended elective course.
●​ CHS 217 Professional Development in Counseling & Human Services will be replaced
by CA 205 Foundations of Career offered by the Career Services Office
●​ Two CHS electives are still required, but the “Focused Elective” category has been
eliminated, reducing the total number of required credits by 9 credits. (We used to
require 5 Focused Electives, including at least 2 CHS courses).
●​ The number of hours for the CHS 440 Practicum in Human Services has been reduced
from 410 to 360. The course is still 9 credit hours and fully meets accreditation
requirements.
●​ Changes result in a decrease in total program requirements from 72 credits to 58 credits.
Student still need a total of 120 credits to earn a B.S. The remaining requirements are
general education courses and electives.
5.

If the Program is delivered at multiple sites:
Table of Contents
a.​ For each site:
●​ Describe the physical location and any unique characteristics.
●​ Identify the faculty, directors, and staff.
●​ Describe the student population.
Response: Although Stevenson’s physical facilities are split across two campuses, they are
integrated into one University, so the Counseling & Human Services Program is not delivered
at multiple sites. Departmental offices and all CHS courses are located on the Owings Mills
campus.
b.​ Furnish evidence of formal policies and procedures that assure continuity and quality
control of Program and Curriculum across all sites.
Response: Not applicable.

I. GENERAL PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS
A. Institutional Requirements and Primary Program Objective
Context: There is strong national commitment to the view that human services programs should
develop professionals who provide direct or indirect services. These programs prepare human services
professionals for a variety of functions related to the care and treatment of individuals, families,
groups, and communities.
Standard 1: The primary program objective shall be to prepare human services professionals to
serve individuals, families, groups, communities and/or other supported human services
organization functions.
Table of Contents
Specifications for Standard 1
a.

The program is part of a degree granting college or university that is regionally accredited.
Response: Stevenson University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher
Education.

b.

Provide evidence that the development of competent human services professionals is the
primary objective of the program and the basis for the degree program title, design, goals and
curriculum, teaching methodology, and program administration (e.g. through documents such as
catalog, brochures, course syllabi, website, and marketing materials).
Response:
The Counseling & Human Services Program is designed for students who want to provide
human services for people in need. The major prepares students for careers in human services
and also for graduate school. The courses provide students with a comprehensive understanding
of how individuals and families develop and function. Students also acquire the skills necessary
to provide services to individuals and families. The Counseling & Human Services Program
goals are designed to prepare students for productive and meaningful work in the human
services field. Graduates are expected to “apply key concepts, methods and values in human
services to professional situations,” as stated in the program purpose and objectives.
The program objectives are focused on preparing our majors for productive and meaningful
experiences in the human services field. Graduates are expected to apply meaningful
connections between classroom learning and experience in the field, demonstrate a professional
attitude with sensitivity to diversity, display appropriate interpersonal skills and professional
behavior, and exhibit their own continuing self-development (See Program Goals).
The program’s focus on developing competent human service professionals is reflected in all
departmental materials, including the Stevenson Catalog (See the Counseling & Human
Services Program under Fields of Study), departmental brochure, and the department website.
See also course descriptions and syllabi for all CHS courses.

c.

Articulate how students are informed of the curricular and program expectations and
requirements prior to admission.
Table of Contents
Response: Prospective students and their parents or guardians may attend one of five “Open
Houses” offered by Stevenson University. During each Open House, faculty and current students
from the Counseling & Human Services Department provide a classroom session in which the
program structure, goals and expectations are reviewed, with opportunities for questions and
discussion. In addition, the Department Chair meets every year with the university recruiters in
the Admissions Office to provide them with updated information about the Counseling &
Human Services Program so they can speak knowledgably about it to potential students.
Current students who are not Counseling & Human Service majors, as well as prospective
students, can access information about the program in numerous ways, including the program
website, individual interviews with faculty, information displayed near the program office, and
at numerous activities and functions offered throughout the year by the Human Services Club.
Many non-majors also take CHS 101 Family Studies or CHS 105 Human Services and Social
Policy to meet the social science requirement and are thereby introduced to the field of human
services.
All students who enter the major, either by transferring from another major or another school, or
by starting at Stevenson, are informed of all aspects of the curricular and program requirements
and expectations in the following ways: Transfer students meet individually with the
Department Chair, who explains all program requirements, provides a student handbook, and
creates an individualized plan of study. New college students participate in a group orientation
before they enter the program where they receive a student handbook and get help with
establishing a plan of study and registering for classes. They also participate in the 1-credit
course FYS 100 First Year Seminar, which has a designated section for Counseling & Human
Services majors.

d.

Provide a brief history of the program.
Table of Contents
Response: The Family Studies Program was developed by Dr. Gigi Franyo in 1999 and began
accepting students in Fall 2000. Dr. Franyo was the program coordinator and only full-time
faculty member until 2004. The name of the program was changed to Family and Community
Services in Spring 2003. Beginning in Fall 2004, the program acquired one additional full-time
faculty member, Dr. Tom Swisher, to teach courses and serve as the field placement coordinator.
The program was awarded accreditation from CSHSE in October of 2004. It expanded to three
full-time faculty members in 2005, when Ms. Lauri Weiner joined the faculty. The name of the
program was changed to Human Services in 2007 and in 2009 the Human Services Program was
reaccredited by CSHSE. In 2012, the Program became a Department when Dr. John Rosicky
was hired as Department Chair. In the fall of 2014, Dr. Mayaugust Finkenberg joined the
full-time faculty when Dr. Franyo began phased retirement. In 2018, the department and
program name was changed to Counseling & Human Services in order to be more easily
recognizable and help with recruiting. In December of 2022, Tom Swisher retired from the
department; this resulted in the “department” designation being changed to “program”.
Department offices moved from the Manning Academic Center (MAC) on the Owings Mills
North campus to the new PAZ library building in January of 2024; all CHS classes are still
offered in MAC.

e.

Describe the student population including the number, gender, and diversity of students, as well
as the numbers of full time, part time, and students graduating each year.
Response: Fall 2023 enrollment figures show 56 Counseling & Human Services majors. The
vast majority are full-time students (96%). Majors are predominantly female (87%) with an
average age of 22. They are from a wide variety of backgrounds, including the city of Baltimore
and surrounding suburbs and rural areas. Most students are from the Mid-Atlantic region. The
major is ethnically diverse (49% white; 45% black; 4% Hispanic; 2% Asian/other). The number
of graduates has been fairly consistent with 24 in the 2018/2019 academic year and 20 in the
2022/2023 academic year. See attached table of enrollment and graduation trends and
demographic information and pictures of recent graduating classes.

as described by Schram and Mandell in An Introduction to Human Services (2000). This model
emphasizes the importance of the following three components to becoming an effective human
services professional: Attitudes, including self-awareness and such personal attributes as
empathy, warmth and genuineness; Skills, including case management, ethical decision-making,
counseling strategies, and group leadership; and Knowledge of topics such as human
development, psychopathology, group and family dynamics, diversity of lifestyles, legal issues
that affect helping, the impact of society and culture on behavior, and the evaluation of research.
b.​ Include a mission statement for the program.
Table of Contents
Response:
The mission of the Counseling & Human Services Program is to provide students with an
educational foundation that will prepare them for meaningful and effective careers within the
human services field and successful continuation of their education.
Purpose
The Counseling & Human Services Department prepares students to become effective
professionals in the helping disciplines. The program focuses on skill development, problem
solving, and the application of research and best practice principles. Students learn to help
others and to prepare thoughtfully and systematically for their careers. To meet these
commitments, the Counseling & Human Services Department offers its students a broad
curriculum, learning experiences and professional activities beyond the classroom, and high
levels of student-faculty interaction and collaboration.
c.​ Demonstrate alignment with the mission of the units in which the program is housed (e.g.,
department, college, university, etc.).
Table of Contents
Response: The Counseling & Human Services Department is housed within the School of
Humanities and Social Sciences (HaSS), along with the following other programs: Psychology,
Criminal Justice, Interdisciplinary Studies, English Language and Literature, History, and Legal
Studies. According to the HaSS web page, the School offers students “a wide range of
possibilities, experiences, and opportunities while maintaining SU’s commitment to small
classes, personal attention, and career preparation. Our programs encourage students to learn
outside the confines of their chosen fields of study as well as outside the classroom.” Students
in the School “learn not just how to do but also why [they] do.”

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

The University is an innovative, coeducational, independent university offering undergraduate
and graduate students a career-focused education marked by individualized attention, civility,
and respect for difference. The university blends the liberal arts with career exploration and
planning, complementing a traditional education with applied learning beyond the classroom.
The university meets students where they are and supports and challenges them to become
reflective and accomplished individuals committed to a lifetime of learning and contribution.
Students graduate with the competence and confidence needed to address creatively the
opportunities and problems facing their communities, the nation, and the world.
The Counseling & Human Services Program at Stevenson utilizes an approach that is
career-focused by offering two distinct field experiences. Individualized attention is emphasized
through advising (students are required to meet with their advisors every semester.), faculty
attention to individual needs (discussed at program faculty meetings), and in the field placement
process (the Field Placement Coordinator meets individually with all prospective interns and
practicum students.). Civility and respect for differences is underscored throughout the Program
through course work. Behavioral guidelines of civility and professionalism are taught to and
assessed for all majors before and during field placements. Special needs accommodations are
available to our majors. Career exploration suited to the unique needs and interests of our
students is an integral part of CHS 380 (Internship in Counseling & Human Services), CHS 441
(Seminar in Counseling & Human Services), and the field placement process.
d.​ Provide a brief description of the major knowledge base and theories from which the curriculum
draws to support the conceptual framework (e.g. counseling theories, biopsychosocial, systems
theory, change theory, etc.).
Table of Contents
Response: The Counseling & Human Services program emphasizes the interdisciplinary,
biopsychosocial approach to helping. Throughout the program, students are introduced to
various theoretical orientations, such as psychoanalysis, behavioral and cognitive-behavioral
approaches to treatment, and client-centered therapies, but the emphasis is on an eclectic
orientation that stresses the importance of flexibility to adapt helping responses to individual
needs and circumstances.
e.​ Describe the multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, or transdisciplinary approach to knowledge,
theories, and skills included in the curriculum.
Table of Contents
Response: The Counseling & Human Services program utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to
knowledge, theories and skills that includes liberal arts courses, human services skills courses,
and field experiences. The general education core curriculum for the University includes an
emphasis on writing, literature, communication, mathematics and scientific reasoning, computer
and information literacy, and the arts and humanities. The Counseling & Human Services major
incorporates courses in psychology, sociology, psychopharmacology, research methods and
statistics. (See program curriculum)

Response: The course matrix for departmental courses is here. The matrix for non-departmental
courses is here.

C. Community Assessment
Context: Human services programs continually interact with and affect human services delivery
within the local community through field placements and alumnae/i. Programs should be designed to
interface with the needs of major employers in terms of job needs and career ladders so there is an
orderly and continuous supply of competent professionals.
Standard 3: The program shall include periodic mechanisms for assessment of and response to
changing policies, needs, and trends of the profession and community.
Specifications for Standard 3:
a.​ If the program is less than five years old, provide documentation that supported the initial
development of the human services program (such as a community needs assessment).
Table of Contents
Response: Program is more than 5 years old.
b.​ An Advisory Committee shall be established to provide feedback regarding local, state, and
national trends and needs, policy changes, and to act as an advocate for the program. The
committee should include individuals representing the human services field, such as field
experience agencies, employing agencies, citizen advocacy groups, alumnae/i, current students,
adjunct faculty, and other persons related to the field of human services. Provide the following:
1.​ A detailed description of the membership of the Advisory Committee (e.g. names, agencies,
roles, relationship to program, etc.),
Response: There are currently 14 external members of the Advisory Board, in addition to the 3
full-time faculty members in the department. The external members represent field placement
agencies, employing agencies, graduate programs, community college human services program,
adjunct faculty, and alumni. Note that the member from CCBC is also deeply involved in
addiction credentialing in the state of Maryland and provides expertise in the area of addiction
counseling, as well as teaching our addiction-related courses. See attached roster of Advisory
Board members.
2.​ Minutes of advisory committee meetings from the last two years
Response: The Advisory Board meets twice a year, typically in September and February.
Minutes from the last four meetings (2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years) are here.
3.​ A narrative or table of how the committee interfaces with the program in relationship to
specific issues.

Response: As illustrated in the Advisory Board minutes, the Board regularly provides helpful
suggestions on such program issues as recruitment, curriculum needs (such as the recently
approved professional writing course), the development of graduate programs, and
internship/practicum requirements (such as the need for paid field experiences). At every
meeting, program enrollment and completion statistics are presented, along with a summary of
internship and practicum placements and the activities of the Human Services Club. During fall
meetings, the annual report, including student feedback, is reviewed with the Board.
Suggestions and comments are encouraged both during and after the meeting.
c.​ Describe other mechanisms, if any, used to respond to changing needs in the human services
field.
Table of Contents
Response: Feedback is solicited from both field experience site supervisors and university
supervisors (practicum only) who work with students in their internship and practicum
placements. The department gets specific feedback on the performance of students and these
supervisors may suggest areas where students, or the program, could improve. Students also
provide feedback on the program before they graduate. All of this information is reviewed by
department faculty and used to plan for program modifications. Formal department meetings
occur every month and include both full-time and part-time instructors.
D. Program Evaluation
Context: To ensure the program is effective in producing competent professionals, the program must
be evaluated on a regular basis. In addition, the program must assess how well the needs of students
and graduates are being met. These evaluations/ assessments are the bases for modifying and
improving the program.
Standard 4: The program shall conduct, and report to the public, consistent formal evaluations,
which determine its effectiveness in meeting the needs of the students, community, and the
human services field.
Specifications for Standard 4:
a.

The program has clear, measureable student learning outcomes that align with the standards and
an assessment plan that has been implemented. Provide the following:

2.​ Assessment plan
Response:
The Assessment Plan for measuring the above student learning outcomes utilizes the evaluation
of student performance in their field placements during their final semester in the program to
determine whether students have met the learning objectives. Each of the program goals and
learning objectives are incorporated into this evaluation tool. Students are rated during their
internship using this evaluation and they are rated at the midpoint of their final practicum
experience, so they have an opportunity to improve on any objectives on which they are below
expectations.
Measures and Timing
Evaluation is a critical part of the Counseling & Human Services Department. The needs of our
communities, both our external community (agencies) and our internal community (students),
are evaluated extensively and frequently through both quantitative and qualitative measures.
QUANTITATIVE MEASURES. Quantitative measures and the timing for each are as follows:
​
a. Agency Evaluation by Student – At end of field placement
​
b. Course Evaluation by Student – At conclusion of fall and spring semester courses
​
c. Field Placement Prerequisites Checklist – Prior to fall and spring field placements
d. Graduate Acceptance by Graduate Programs – Annually at conclusion of spring
semester
​
e. Graduate Evaluation by Employer – Every five years (1 year after graduation)
​
f. Program Evaluation by Senior – Immediately after completion of program
​
g. Program Evaluation by Graduate – Annually (1 year after graduation)
​
h. Program Evaluation/Student Field Placement Evaluation by Student and Field
Instructor – At midpoint and end of field placement
i. Student Assessment by Faculty (Behavioral Indicators) – Commencing when student
joins major.
j. University Faculty Supervisor Evaluation by Student – At end of field placement.
​
QUALITATIVE INFORMATION. Qualitative information and the timing for each are as
follows:
a. Advisory Board Meetings - One meeting per semester plus unscheduled
communication
b. Faculty Evaluation by Department Chair – Course syllabi and objectives are reviewed
every semester. Faculty members are observed regularly, following the University
guidelines. Faculty Professional Development Plans are reviewed and discussed with
faculty members during the annual Performance Appraisal Meeting.

c. Faculty Meetings - One meeting per month plus unscheduled communication
d. Focus Groups of Graduates – At completion of program
e. Midterm Faculty Evaluation by Student – At midpoint of fall and spring semester
courses
f. Program Evaluation by Student (Focus Group) – At completion of program
g. Responses to additional open-ended questions on all quantitative measures listed
above – Timing varies as shown above.

​

The field placement evaluation is the primary measure for student learning outcomes. However,
additional measures for some of the outcomes occur in other courses. Goal 1, which involves the
use of research literature to analyze problems in human services and the importance of ethics in
social research, is assessed during CHS 224 Introduction to Research. Goal 4, regarding
culturally sensitive behavior, is partially assessed during CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural
Competence. Both of these goals are also assessed in the final field placement evaluation, but
specific assignments and evaluations during these courses provide additional evidence of
student achievement.
3.​ Examples of assessment tools, e.g., rubrics, exams, portfolios, surveys, capstone evaluations,
etc.
Response: The field placement evaluation tool is presented in the Appendix. Students rate
themselves at both the midpoint and end of their field experience (the same evaluation is used
for both the internship and practicum, so students are familiar with the items). They are then
rated by their site supervisor, who discusses the ratings with the student. For each of the six
major learning goals and associated objectives, students are rated as being below expectations,
meeting expectations, or exceeding expectations. These ratings are reviewed by the University
Supervisor and used as both an evaluation of the student’s course performance and as a learning
tool for students to improve their performance.
4.​ A description of how the evaluation may or may not have resulted in any change.
Response: One important result of recent program evaluations was the modification of the
writing course that was created in 2014 to address an identified need to help students strengthen
writing skills. That need still exists, but the writing requirements have been distributed between
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, the newly created CHS 217 Professional
Development in Counseling & Human Services, and CHS 360 Counseling Strategies for
Individuals which incorporates the writing of case notes, incident reports and treatment plans.
Students have consistently requested more variety in focused elective offerings. Elective courses
have been expanded to include Trauma and Crisis Intervention, Therapeutic Recreation,
Disability Studies, Coping, and Resilience and Growth Focused Counseling, in addition to
regular offerings. See the schedule of elective offerings.
Students frequently mentioned that the textbook for the seminar would have been helpful during
the internship. As a result of these suggestions, the textbook (Successful Internship by Sweitzer
and King) is now introduced in the internship and several chapters are used in that course.
Students frequently comment on the challenging time demands of the practicum and the stress
and exhaustion that they feel. Partly as a result of this feedback, the 12-credit (540 hour) option
for the practicum is being eliminated for students entering the program. The practicum will be
9-credits and 410 hours for all students going forward.

b.

The program shall conduct a formal program evaluation every five years. The formal evaluation
shall include: student surveys, agency surveys, graduate follow-up surveys (directed to both
graduates and their employers), active participation of the advisory committee, involvement of
agencies where students are in field placements, course and faculty evaluations, and evaluative
data mandated or conducted by the institution. Provide the following:
Table of Contents
1.​ A history of program evaluations
Response: Comprehensive program evaluations that include the results of faculty and course
evaluations, agency surveys, graduate surveys, and student surveys, as well as the active
participation of the Advisory Board, have occurred annually since 2005. Employer evaluations
of graduates occur regularly. These evaluations are supplemented by self-studies completed
every five years for Council reaccreditation. Here is the Program Evaluation for 2018-2019.
2.​ A description of the methodology
Response:
Both quantitative and qualitative measures are employed to evaluate the Program. See the
Program Evaluation Plan and copies of evaluation tools in the appendix. Evaluation tools that
focus on faculty members are described in Standard 8.
Students complete quantitative evaluations of various facets of the Program, including
evaluations of instructors (at midterm and end of each course), courses (at midterm and end of
each course), field placement agencies (at midterm and end of field placement), University
supervisors, agency supervisors, and, upon their completion of the Program and annually (one
year after graduation), students evaluate the Program itself. Other quantitative evaluations are
completed of graduate acceptance by graduate programs and by employers of Program
graduates.
Qualitative evaluations of field placement agencies utilized by the Program are made by
University Supervisors in written submissions to the Field Placement Coordinator (at midterm
and end of field placement) and by the Field Placement Coordinator in semester and annual
assessments and revisions of what agencies are appropriate for field placements. In addition,
qualitative evaluations are conducted each semester and in unscheduled communication by
Program Advisory Board members. The Department Chair conducts qualitative evaluations of
faculty, as more fully explained in the narrative for Standard 8, through a combination of review
of syllabi and course objectives, classroom observations, and annual performance appraisals.
Other qualitative evaluations occur by faculty at monthly faculty meetings, by seniors in focus
groups at the completion of the Program, and in response to open ended questions on
quantitative measures.
The Program Evaluation is disseminated by the Department Chair to faculty members, Advisory
Board members, and the Field Placement Coordinator. The recipients then provide their input
and recommendations regarding the Program Evaluation and the Program itself. See response to
Standard 4c1 below for more details about dissemination of evaluation results.
3.​ A summative analysis of the most recent evaluation
Response:
The most recently completed formal program evaluation was for the 2018-2019 academic year.
(See the full report here.) In summary, the results confirm that the present curriculum and field

​

experiences are effective in meeting the program mission, “to provide students with an
educational foundation that will prepare them for meaningful and effective careers within the
human services field and successful continuation of their education.” Student field placement
evaluations also indicate that the program goals are being met.
Students praised their CHS courses and the Counseling & Human Services faculty. Some
suggestions related to the Counseling & Human Services curriculum included an expansion of
topics course offerings and tracks to include such areas as: child life, disabilities and special
education, counseling for children and youth, and school counseling.
Several students questioned the usefulness of some of the general education courses and other
non-departmental courses.
4.​ A description of how and in what way the evaluation resulted in any change.
Response:
One important result of recent program evaluations was the reduction in the required hours for
the practicum from 410 hours to 360 hours. There had been a number of comments about the
stresses and mental health effects of the practicum. While learning to create a healthy work-life
balance is part of professional growth, that can still be achieved in a slightly less demanding
schedule.
Students have consistently requested more variety in focused elective offerings. Elective courses
have been expanded to include Trauma and Crisis Intervention, Social Justice, Disability
Studies, Coping, and Resilience and Growth Focused Counseling, in addition to regular
offerings. See the attached schedule of elective offerings.
Students frequently mentioned that the textbook for the seminar would have been helpful during
the internship. As a result of these suggestions, the textbook (Successful Internship by Sweitzer
and King) is now introduced in the internship and several chapters are used in that course.
c.

The program must routinely provide reliable information to the public on its performance,
including student achievement. [NOTE: This Specification relates to accreditation standards or
policies that require institutions or programs routinely to provide reliable information to the

E. Policies and Procedures for Admitting, Retaining, and Dismissing Students
Context: Students have a right to know, prior to enrollment, the standards of the human services
program and the procedures for admitting, retaining, and dismissing students. Both academic and
behavioral issues need to be considered.
Standard 5: The program shall have written standards and procedures for admitting, retaining,
and dismissing students.
Specifications for Standard 5:
a.

Provide documentation of policies regarding the selection and admission of students.
Table of Contents
Response:
Students enter the program in accordance with the University's admission policies and
procedures. See the Admissions section of the University Catalog online. There are no
additional requirements for the Program. Students are able to enter the program at the
beginning of their first year or at any point throughout their college career; however, all
requirements for the program must be completed prior to graduation.

b.

Provide documentation of policies and procedures for referring students for individualized
personal and academic assistance. These policies must be consistent with the institution’s
policies.
Table of Contents
Response:
As a relatively small program, students are well known to departmental faculty and the support
and ultimate success of every student is a priority. Each student is assigned a faculty advisor,
and concerns (as well as plans to address them) about any students by any faculty members are
discussed at every Department faculty meeting. Concerns about any issues, either academic or
personal, are referred to the Office of Student Success, either through direct contact with staff in
that office or through an Early Alert notification. The Office of Student Success follows up on
all concerns and makes appropriate referrals as needed, keeping faculty members informed
throughout the process. In addition, the University has a Wellness Center which offers a
personalized environment, addressing an individual's needs through health and counseling
services. While no referral form is used, faculty provide information about the Wellness Center
to students who may need this resource and make contact with the Director of the Wellness
Center about students referred. For more information about this service, visit the website

Several University initiatives that potentially affect the wellness and support of students in the
Counseling & Human Services Program include the existence of a Director of Multicultural
Affairs, the University's written statement on accommodations, the Academic Link, and the
Office of Student Success, as described in the following:
Director of Multicultural Affairs. This position was first filled in July 2003. The Director
of Multicultural Affairs coordinates the College's efforts to foster a diverse learning and
working environment. The Director provides counsel in initiating, developing, and
implementing short and long-range plans related to diversity efforts. He or she develops
and maintains collaborative relationships with students, faculty, staff, community groups,
and professional organizations while developing and implementing diversity and
multi-cultural programs. The University also promotes multi-cultural events and speakers,
including “Multi-Cultural Week.”
University accommodations for students with disabilities. The Program adheres to the
University policy on disability. A disabled student is referred to the University’s Office of
Student Success if he or she is not currently involved with them. Faculty in the Program
work with Student Success Services to make sure the student has the accommodations
needed to be successful in the program. Policy and procedures regarding students with
disabilities are outlined online here.
The Academic Link. Students work together with tutors as a team to learn effective study
strategies, increase understanding of course content, and become independent learners. Any
University student is eligible for free tutoring or other academic assistance in most subjects.
More information about The Academic Link is available online.
The Center for Student Success. The Center for Student Success provides services and
resources to students, faculty and staff that will strengthen academic performance, enhance
student satisfaction, and improve student retention. For a complete description of the
numerous services provided by this office, visit the website.

c.

Provide documentation of written policies and procedures describing the due process for
probation, dismissal, appeal, and grievance procedures affecting students.
Table of Contents
Response:
The Counseling & Human Services Program follows the University’s policies and procedures
related to due process for probation, dismissal, appeal, and grievance procedures. Redress of
student grievances and the policies and procedures regarding disciplinary proceedings can be
found in the Stevenson University Policy Manual, Vol. V: Student Policies. Procedures for due
process and appeal of all decisions are clearly laid out in this document, which is available to
students on the SU portal and is included here on the thumb drive.

d.

Provide documentation of program policies and procedures for assessing and managing student
attributes, characteristics, and behaviors (“fitness for the profession”) that are important for the
success of human service professionals.

Table of Contents
Response: The Program’s behavioral expectations are included in the Counseling & Human
Services Student Handbook. Ethical behavior is addressed in the section on Department
Procedures and in Appendix F, which lists the “Ethical Standards of Human Service
Professionals.” A copy of the Handbook is provided to all Counseling & Human Services
majors when they enter the major and they sign a New Student Acknowledgement Form
confirming that they have received a handbook and agree to abide by the ethical standards.
Faculty members who have a concern related to a student’s behavior document the concern with
specific behaviors and discuss their concern with the individual student. The student's advisor is
also notified. A list of “behavioral indicators” addressing respect for others, interpersonal skills,
and professionalism is provided in the Counseling & Human Services Student Handbook here.
In addition to their presence in the Handbook, the Behavioral Indicators are reviewed when
students enter the major and in both the Professional Development course (CHS 217) and
Internship course (CHS 380).
Time is set aside at every faculty meeting for faculty members to raise any concerns they may
have about students, including behavioral or legal concerns. A plan on whether or how to
address concerns is discussed and documented. Common initial outcomes include discussion of
the concern between the instructor and student, referral of the student to his or her advisor,
referral of the student to the Program Coordinator, referral of the student to the Stevenson
Wellness Center, and/or referral of the student to another appropriate resource (see Department
Meeting Minutes).
Satisfactory performance in CHS 380 (internship and accompanying seminar) is required for the
practicum (CHS 440). Unsatisfactory performance (a grade below C) in CHS 380 will result in
ineligibility for CHS 440. Students whose performance in CHS 380 is unsatisfactory are
permitted to repeat the course. A second grade below C in CHS 380 will result in dismissal
from the program (See CHS Student Handbook here).
Students who have prior legal problems are not denied admission to the major; however, some
field placements sites will not accept students who have a criminal record. Students are advised
that they may need to submit to criminal background checks at internship or practicum sites.
Prior to assignment of potential field placements, students complete a survey form asking that
they explain any issues or limitations that could impact their field placement (such as disability,
criminal record, citizenship) (See Appendix 5, pp. 2, 3.). Agencies that require a personal
background check make the arrangements for doing so with the student. Procedures for handling
issues which may arise during the field placement experience are addressed in the Field
Placement Handbook here and here in the Counseling & Human Services Student Handbook.

F. Credentials of Human Services Faculty
Context: Human services programs have relied primarily on professionals from fields such as human
services, psychology, sociology, social work, counseling, political science, adult education, and
nursing to provide teaching faculty. Since both field and classroom orientations are important
characteristics of teaching staff, consideration should be given to faculty trained in human services
and/or interdisciplinary methods and approaches.

Describe the process for faculty and staff evaluation. Documentation may come from a variety
of sources and may include, among others, student evaluations, administrative review,
comments from field placement agencies, and peer review.
Response:
Each faculty member in the Counseling & Human Services Program is evaluated annually by
the Department Chair and by themselves. In addition, faculty members are evaluated by students
at midterm and at the semester conclusion of every course.
An extensive, University-wide faculty evaluation system provides a vehicle for the
documentation of successful teaching and for the citation of areas where instructional
improvement is being undertaken. All faculty members, full-time or adjunct, are expected to be
actively documenting their performance and working to expand their competence as instructors.
The system includes three criteria, which correspond to criteria for faculty rank. They are
professional competence and scholarship, teaching effectiveness, and service to the college and
profession (not required for adjuncts).
The following table outlines the variety of resources through which the three criteria for faculty
evaluation are evaluated:
