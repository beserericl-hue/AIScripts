Welcome Back! We spent some time getting caught up with each other.
Updated Grading and Passing Standards
●​ John described the updated grading scale, which is in effect starting this semester.
There is no long a C- grade; a grade of C goes from 70-76%. There is no D+
grade; a grade of D is 60-69%. Students on the 2018-2019 catalog year only need a
D in order to get SEE credit for a course (this includes CHS 101 and 201).
HOWEVER, all students still need a C or better in courses for them to count as
program requirements.
Move to OMN Campus in January
●​ Our move to the Owings Mills campus has been officially approved. Our offices
will be in the Manning Academic Center: N172-174; N176-178. We spent some
time reviewing the layout of these rooms, looking at pictures, and discussing how
we could make the space accommodating to our needs. Lauri expressed an interest
in have N177 as her office. We need to specify which 4 offices we would like to
use and who will do in each one. The other two offices will be shared with
adjuncts from other departments and won’t be locked, but we can use them for
space to meet with students. We will want to advocate for appropriate signage so

61

students can find the offices and for the ability to decorate and provide
comfortable furniture for students.
●​ In spring, all of our courses will be offered on the Owings Mills campus. We will
be able to essentially retain our current course times; exact locations of classes will
be determined once the schedule is developed.
Student Updates
●​ Kayleigh Treshman was in a car accident. She is injured and will miss some class
time, but she will be OK. She had missed a couple of classes before the accident as
well.
●​
Department Issues:
●​ Thank you to Loryn for mentioning to folks at Levindale that we could possibly
provide training in medical technology. I am in talks with Ann Davis at SUO on
having us develop and provide non-credit training at both NCIA and at Levindale.
Loryn will work with us on this initiative.
●​ Mayaugust is putting together materials for CHS 362 Trauma & Crisis
Intervention. We decided to make it a 300 level class and include “trauma” in the
title. That will be offered in the spring. Tom will be developing CHS 365 Coping,
Resilience and Positive Psychology for the fall.
●​ The First Year Seminar class has 10 students. They will participate in Mustangs
Make a Difference Day on Oct. 12
Program Planning Discussion:
●​ We had a robust discussion about program planning in general. We discussed the
following questions:
●​ Why do students come to our program?
o​ Having had prior experiences with needing help; giving back
o​ Learn how to work with others
o​ A stepping stone to graduate programs in counseling and social work
o​ Interest in being a school counselor, because they had a good (or bad)
experience with their own counselor)
●​ What would our program motto be, if we had one?
o​ We make a difference
o​ Caring, Leaning, Growing, Giving
o​ Helping starts here
●​ What is our unique value proposition? What to students get from the program?
o​ Professional preparation/field experience
o​ The ability to apply theory to practice
o​ Caring faculty; personal mentoring
o​ A transformative experience; self-awareness and personal growth

62

●​ What challenges does the program face?
o​ Recruitment/growth
o​ Reputation of less rigor than other programs
o​ Retention – getting students to complete despite life issues/money; need for
support
o​ Need to recruit transfer students from community colleges
o​ Need to integrate commuter students and help them feel part of the
college/program

Move to OMN Campus in January
●​ We will be moving to the MAC over winter break. Faculty have selected offices:
N172 (John), N173 (Tom), N177 (Lauri), N178 (Mayaugust). N174 and N176 will be

63

shared with adjuncts from other departments and won’t be locked, but we can use
them for space to meet with students. John will order boxes to be delivered to
faculty offices so we can start working on packing up. He will also work on
getting keys, signage and painting. We discussed other aspects of the move, as
well.
Human Services Club
●​ Lauri reported that the club is struggling and that officers are frustrated about
attendance and participation of CHS majors. Few, if any, CHS majors are showing
up at events such as the NAMI activities.
Student Issues
●​ Advising starts next week. Faculty should send email to advisees about signing up
for advising. John will send documents (sample program, focused electives,
general education (SEE) and course offering schedule). Advisers were encouraged
to talk up club activities and to keep student plans updated.
●​ We reviewed the list of potential practicum and internship students. Practicum
students are all in good shape. There was some concern about Kayla Chapman, as
she will be expecting a baby during the spring semester, which will likely impact
her placement. Several internship students have low grade point averages that need
to be raised in order to be eligible for practicum. Mayaugust expressed concern
about Alexis Grimes, who has not set up a meeting to discuss internship placement
or responded to requests. Mayaugust will send her an email indicating that if she
doesn’t respond, it will be assumed that she won’t be doing an internship.
Department Issues:
●​ The Trauma & Crisis Intervention course has been approved and Mayaugust will
teach that in the spring. Tom will work with John on the Resilience and Coping
class; John will send him the course approval form from the other course.
●​ The topics course in the spring will be Divorce and Remarriage and will be taught
by Lauri
●​ Barbara will not be able to teach in the spring due to the long trip from Delaware.
Loryn said that she could teach the CHS 340 sections, if they were moved to the
evenings.
●​ Textbook orders are due soon. John indicated that he would be keeping books the
same unless notified otherwise. The CHS 101 text (Benokraitis) may only be
available to students in an electronic format.

Student Issues
●​ Mayaugust is having a difficult time placing Destiny Stokes at an internship site.
Destiny has interviewed at three places and been turned down. She expresses
interests in administrative positions, but has not always followed through with
suggested placements. She is not interested in ARC. We talked extensively about
the issues involved and several suggestions were made about potential placement
sites. Destiny has interviewed at Progress Unlimited and thought the interview
went well. We’ll see how it goes.
●​ Kariza Govcalves was denied placement at the Shafer Center due to concerns
expressed about her safety in working with potentially volatile youths given her
visual impairment. The SU Disabilities Office is aware of this issue and based on
concerns about discrimination has requested that we not use the Shafer Center.
John will follow up with the new director of disabilities, Katey St. Clair Earle.
Kariza is progressing towards a placement at St. Elizabeth School.
●​ Jaylin Johnson continues to be a concern based on inconsistent attendance.
●​ Mayaugust indicated that Alexis Grimes continues to be a concern. She has
responded only when absolutely necessary. She considered switching to

65

Interdisciplinary Studies and spoke with Dr. Horrocks, but decided to continue
with Human Services. She still does not have a confirmed placement. It was
pointed out that the responsibility needs to be on her to do the work needed to
secure a placement.
●​ Noel Martin has decided to enter the major. Loryn indicated that her work and
attitude seem to reflect a high-school mindset.
●​ Kaitlin McMillan is failing CHS 101. She does not seem to grasp assignments
despite seeming to work hard. Lauri submitted an early alert previously. John will
notify the disabilities office about her struggles.
●​ Lauri spoke with Kevin Joppy about expectations that he was not meeting. He
was failing CHS 101 and several of his other classes at midterms.
●​ Mayaugust mentioned that Jessica Waugh has been late in turning in her work and
missing classes.
Department Issues
●​ In discussing registration issues, Lauri mentioned that several students have
expressed concerns about the Service Learning requirement in CHS 360. This led
to an in-depth discussion of how the service learning component of that course has
been working. At some sites, the work has not been appropriate for students or
there hasn’t been enough to do. Scheduling has been an issue and flexibility has
been granted related to the 20 hour requirement. Some students have stated that
they didn’t realize this was an expectation. John will add the designation to the
curriculum plan as one way to make this clearer. In early spring, we will make
service learning a continuing topic of discussion.
Move to OMN Campus in January
●​ We will be moving to the MAC over winter break. Faculty have selected offices:
N172 (John), N173 (Tom), N177 (Lauri), N178 (Mayaugust). N174 and N176 will be
shared with adjuncts from other departments and won’t be locked, but we can use
them for space to meet with students. Boxes have been delivered and we can start
packing whenever we want. A date for boxes to be moved can be scheduled when
we are ready (probably the week of Dec. 17-21, but Mayaugust indicated she
might want to wait until January). Book cases, file drawers, and furniture for the
hallway have been requested. John met with Janine Mills to talk about painting
one wall of our hallway blue and using the same blue as a background for signs
pointing the way to our area. The faculty lounge down the hall from our offices
has a full refrigerator, microwave and bathrooms. A scantron and copier is
available on south side of building. Lauri requested cleaning and vacuuming of
offices. Mayaugust asked about the possibility of having the hutch on her desk
moved to the other side of the desk. Lauri volunteered to act as the contact person
for the move in January while John is out of the country.

66

Department Issues (cont.)
●​ Departmental brochures have been updated to reflect the new department name.
●​ Kim Button has started work as the student assistant to the department. She will be
working on social media and promotional materials, but can perform other work as
needed.
●​ John asked about general stress levels on campus. The consensus was that students
were mostly focused on college-related stresses. There have been some health
concerns.
●​ We need another artifact for program assessment in the spring semester. One
possibility is the grant proposal assignment from the CHS 340/540 class. The
theory assignment from 430 will not work because it is a group assignment. We
could also use the portfolio again.
●​ This brought up a discussion about updating the portfolio assignment and
requiring an electronic portfolio. John and Lauri will both look into software
available for e-portfolios. To address the issue of students not making
modifications between classes, we could also have them include a “changes made”
section in the assignment. We will discuss the portfolio assignment in more detail
in the spring.
●​ Textbook orders are due soon. The CHS 101 text (Benokraitis) has gone to a new
edition and students will be purchasing access to an e-book. Faculty were given
copied of the updated edition.
●​ We talked briefly about gifts for practicum sites and others. John will ask Rita
about the portable cell phone chargers, or we could get more of the key
rings/lights.
The following upcoming fall events and activities were briefly reviewed:
●​ Admissions Events

This was the first meeting of the semester and in the department’s new location on the
Owings Mills North campus. Loryn talked about her trip to Cambodia and China over the
winter break and John described the travel study trip to Ecuador. We hope to do another
trip in January 2020, but John will not be able to go, so someone else will need to step
forward.
Classrooms seem to be working effectively, despite a few adjustments. Students (and
faculty) are finding their way around the new building. We discussed use of OneDrive to
access, store and download/upload files. John asked if there were supply needs, since we
need to get our own now (Carol mentioned gradebooks). We discussed ideas for the
bulletin board outside of faculty offices – ideas included: current events “In the News”, a
list of field placement and employment sites, Ecuador pictures and other pictures of
departmental events.
Student Issues
●​ The deadline to add/drop in next Tuesday.
●​ Loryn will talk to Victoria Carter about switching her schedule so she doesn’t
have courses back-to-back on different campuses.
●​ Attendance verification is due next week.
●​ Field placements seem to be going smoothly. Lily Dondero has not been able to
start yet and Jaylin Johnson requested to switch his placement shortly before the
beginning of the semester, which was granted, but he is now having some
transportation issues. Villa Maria has been a concern – the school has been chaotic
and our students witnessed a fight and chair throwing incident. The residences may
be a better placement location in the future.
Department Issues
●​ We discussed the departmental acronym and course designator. It was agreed that
we should be consistent in referring to the department as CHS and use that as the
designator for all courses. There will need to be a systematic effort to let students

68

and other area of the college know about the shift. John will talk to Cheryl and the
registrar about this.
●​ Use gradebook in Blackboard was discussed. We will all need to start doing using
that feature in the fall. Several faculty offered to help anyone who needed to set up
this feature.
●​ Students have had some questions about the eText for CHS 101. Faculty have been
frustrated by a lack of clear instructions from the publisher and bookstore.
●​ The graduate panel for practicum students is scheduled for Feb. 25. Representative
from two graduate programs (UMB MSW program and the Chicago School of
Professional Psychology) will be included in the panel. We talked about a possible
articulation with the UM program as John has heard indirectly that they may be
open to this. If our students were able to get advanced standing when entering the
program, that would be very beneficial. John will follow up on this.
●​ Faculty evaluation forms are due by Feb. 8. John has communicated with faculty
as needed and apologized for the last minute request.
●​ The self-study for CSHSE reaccreditation is due at the end of the summer. John
will be working on the report through the spring semester and will need input from
faculty. He will be requesting specific information as needed.
●​ There was a discussion about moving to e-portfolios for students who are putting
together their professional portfolios. There was a general consensus that this
would be a good idea, but it was unclear how best to roll out that change. We
eventually agreed that we would let current practicum students have the option to
create e-portfolios as a pilot to see what they come up with. John will look at some
online options for free portfolio software.
●​ We will be examining the incorporation of service learning in CHS 360.
Mayaugust and Carol will be talking about this more before the next meeting. One
possibility (which came up after the meeting) was that service learning might be
incorporated in to the new CHS 217 Professional Development course instead of
CHS 360.

The meeting was held by conference call due to inclement weather.
Student Issues
●​ Nicole Rogers is having significant issues with her roommate who has a 30-year
old boyfriend who stays frequently in the room. Loryn recognized this from class
conversations and met with Nicole and Lauri. John has reported the issue to Sarah
Mansfield in residence life.
●​ Alex Lutz has been having some issues in practicum, not turning in
journals/reflections on time. The University Supervisor has expressed some
concern. John will follow up in seminar.
●​ Kevin Joppy continues to have poor attendance and student work habits in CHS
201 with Loryn. He did not register for to re-take CHS 101 this semester. Lauri
recommended an Early Alert, continuing to push him to meet expectations, and
will follow up with him in advising.
Department Issues
●​ The list of seven potential practicum students for fall was distributed. Steven
Sneed has a 2.375 GPA. He needs to get A’s and B’s this semester to bring that up
to at least a 2.45 to be eligible for practicum. He has been given this message
consistent for the past several semesters. His options, if he does not make the
cutoff, are to switch to Interdisciplinary Studies or re-take courses. He is doing
well in CHS 340 and 380 so far this semester; hopefully he will get the grades he
needs to progress. All other students on the list look like they will meet
requirements. There was a consensus that Tyler Steinberg general does the
minimum needed to meet requirements, although his grades have improved in the
past two semesters.

70

●​ We went through the course titles, descriptions and prerequisites for all courses
and added Counseling & Human Services where appropriate. John will submit
course change forms to the registrar’s office.
●​ Faculty were encouraged to submit academic integrity reports whenever there is a
suspicion of a violation.
●​ There will be no travel study option offered this January. We will plan to offer
another international study course in 2021.
●​ There was an extended discussion about options for taking students to a
conference as part of the Professional Development Award. We do not have
sufficient funds to take two students and all faculty to a conference that involves
flying to the destination. Options we discussed included taking students, but just
with one or two faculty; suspending the award for this year (but this will likely be
an ongoing problem); taking students to a regional NOHS conference in the
spring; or finding another fall conference within driving distance that we can take
students to. John was not able to identify a good option, but will look for a
possibility and let faculty know.
●​ There was a discussion about ways to reduce the overall number of credits
required by the program. It was agreed that it would be a good idea NOT to do
anything this year when we are completing the re-accreditation study. In the future
options for reducing the number of credits include: going from 5 to 3 focused
electives (keeping the requirement that two of those focused electives be CHS
classes); eliminating SOC 101; making the statistics requirement a
recommendation.
●​ It was agreed that CHS 217 would not be a good place for service learning, since it
is not available to non-majors and a major purpose of the course is to give students
exposure to a variety of career areas. CHS 360 will not be service learning in the
fall. CHS 201 may be the best place for service learning; John will talk with Loryn
about integrating this.

Student Issues
●​ Izzy Ramsland had another car accident late last night. She is OK, but has a
broken wrist. Candace Baker is following up with her about how she is doing on
time at her placement. She may need extra time at the end of the semester.
●​ Alex Lutz met with Mayaugust twice about ongoing failure to get her journals in
on time to her University Supervisor and general minimal effort, though she is
doing fine at Art with a Heart. We are still hoping for some improvement. Alex is
not in immediate danger of not successfully completing the practicum.
●​ Jaylin Johnson will not complete his internship and is switching to
Interdisciplinary Studies.
●​ Danzel Wright has been missing some classes and needs to continue being pushed
to meet expectations of student professionalism.
●​ Eboni Jackson has had issues with showing up late to class, but participates well
when she attends. She will hopefully pass 220 on her second attempt.
●​ Julia Ertel has been struggling with the interactive activities in 250. She came late
to class this week and wanted to jump into the mediation exercise that was already
in progress, but was not able to do so. Her social awkwardness can interfere with
her full participation.
●​ Kayla Chapman gave birth to a healthy baby girl on March 21. She plans to
return to her practicum placement after the Easter break and will need to complete
an extra month of placement after the end of the semester.
●​ Breyona Johnson was complimented by Mayo for her independent work on
developing a partnership project with Poly High School in Baltimore. This would
be a good opportunity to highlight accomplishments of both alumni and current
students.
Department Issues
●​ Cheryl provided some background on the development of the Community Health
program, which is currently being proposed as a new track in the Counseling &
Human Services program. There will be three new CMH courses (Intro to

72

Community Health, Healthcare Systems Administration, and a Seminar in
Community Health), plus a communication course and two BIO courses. These
will count as focused electives. Students in this track will not have to take two
CHS focused electives. The program is going before AAC next week. There was a
general consensus that this would fit well with our program and be a positive for
enrollement.
●​ Registration and advising issues were discussed. Students who still need LAW 259
may need to get a substitution (CHS 275 may work for many students).
●​ After a discussion of Graduation Awards, we agreed that JT would be nominated
for both the SU Pin and the Orsia Young Leadership Award. We will nominate
Alishia Foreman for the Knott award. Kelly Schwager and Alexis Young may be
candidates for the Provost’s Award, based on academic achievement.
●​ After a review of JT’s ePortfolio, we agreed that we would again give students in
the fall practicum the option to submit portfolios electronically or in hard copy. JT
used wixsite.com to do his portfolio. We will show the advisory board both an
electronic and hard copy of a portfolio in the fall to get their feedback on which is
preferable. When Tom Flis (from Sheppard Pratt) was doing a guest lecture in
CHS380, he was very impressed by the physical portfolio and said it would be an
advantage in a job interview.
●​ Following additional discussion about conference options, it was decided that we
will take two students to the national NOHS conference in Anaheim in October.
Tom got the Professional Development funding to attend and is awaiting
acceptance of his presentation proposal. Mayaugust will give internship students
the application and encourage them to apply by April 29.
●​ Service Learning will be integrated into CHS 201 in the fall.
●​ We reviewed upcoming events, including the Honors Induction on April 16.
●​ Lauri announced that Stevenson received a Jewish Life grant for $7,500 and that
she would be charged with administering it.
The following upcoming fall events and activities were briefly reviewed:

Student Issues
●​ Professional Development Award winners Alyssa Livesay and Rachael Caro were
announced and will be meeting with John and Tom to plan travel and poster
presentation.
●​ Steve Sneed reported that he is expecting a 3.0 this semester, which should be
sufficient to raise his GPA to close to 2.5 before his practicum in the fall. It was
unanimously agreed that if he gets to a cumulative GPA of 2.45 or higher that we
would “round up” and allow him to complete his practicum in the fall.
●​ Eboni Jackson has not completed work for Loryn’s CHS 540 section. She needs
to complete that course and can’t switch her registration to CHS 340. She is barely
passing CHS 220 and 270, but still may pull it out.
●​ Kim Button has been missing classes and assignments in CHS 220 and 315 and
there is concern about her status.
●​ Bella McCumbie continues to struggle with social anxiety disorder and was
recently granted disability accommodations. She has been missing classes and may
ultimately have difficulty progressing in the major.
●​ Hannah “Noel” Martin has had inconsistent attendance and may not pass some
classes (CHS 270 and CHS 340).
●​ Kariza Goncalves has returned from medical leave related to her vision and will
finish her internship.
●​ Kayla Chapman will also finish her practicum (she will have an incomplete
extension until the end of May) and graduate this semseter.
●​ Kaitlyn McMillan works hard, but struggles with a cognitive disability and often
seems to “not get it”, though her participation in class is good
●​ Melody Timmons will be returning in the fall. She has two more classes to
complete and then her practicum in the spring. She reports that it is likely she will
not pass the statistics course she has been taking at a community college. John will
look into possible alternatives to help her complete the program.
Department Issues
●​ The Community Health track has been approved. The course (CMH 210) is
available his fall, but so far has only 1 person registered.
●​ Congratulations to Mayaugust on her promotion to Associate Professor.
●​ CHS 217 Professional Development will be offered in the fall. Mayaugust will
teach two sections. CHS 201 will be a service learning course and John will email
students to notify them. CHS 360 will incorporate material on writing case notes
and have less emphasis on the theories of counseling. Carol and Bunny are
working on these changes.
●​ John will need updated CV’s from faculty for the self-report, as well as the
instructions for major assignments.
●​ We planned a social gather at John’s house in Crownsville the afternoon of July 11.
Invitations are pending.
