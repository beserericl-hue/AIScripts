GRADUATE SCHOOL AND CAREER PREPARATION
[Handbook]

Counseling & Human Services graduates are well prepared both to enter graduate programs such
as social work, human services, counseling, and school counseling and to assume careers in
human services. The major’s curriculum of theory and skills courses emphasizes field
experiences, which are a significant part of this preparation. These experiences range from
conducting an observation or interview in the introductory course to participating in a 410 or
540-hour practicum during the senior year. The experiences enable our students to prepare for
careers by:
●​ applying theory to practice,
●​ associating with professional mentors,
●​ evaluating their appropriateness for a career in human services,
●​ connecting with possible job opportunities,
●​ developing critical professional skills in team work, problem solving,
counseling/interviewing, and interpersonal relations, and
●​ enhancing essential personal qualities such as dependability, responsibility, and
reliability.
Human services majors at Stevenson University have the opportunity to complete their B.S. in
Human Services from Stevenson University and M.S. in Human Services Management:
Special Education from McDaniel College in 5 years. Students who intend to apply for this
program should enroll in CHS 515 and CHS 540 instead of CHS 315 and CHS 340. Students
who have been accepted into the Human Services Management program may enroll in McDaniel
College’s EDU 550 Research Methodology, during their senior year at Stevenson University.
Accepted students participating in CHS 440 will be required to complete a minimum of 50% of
their field placement hours with Target Community and Educational Services.
Students may complete the M.S. in Healthcare Management at Stevenson University or the
M.S. in Community Based Education and Leadership following graduation. Either of these
two degrees may be completed in 5 years if students apply to the accelerated program in their
sophomore year and take CHS 515 and CHS 540 at the graduate level.
Graduates of the Human Services Department are prepared to take the exam for certification as a
Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) offered by the Center for
Credentialing and Education.
Graduates who choose the Addictions Track complete the academic work required for
certification by the Maryland Board of Professional Counselors and Therapists as a Certified
Associate Counselor-Alcohol & Drug (CAC-AD). Certification requires additional supervised
work experience following graduation.

23

SECTION II:
DEPARTMENT PROCEDURES

24

ADMISSION PROCEDURES

Once admitted to Stevenson University, students may declare a major in Counseling & Human
Services. There are no departmental admissions requirements. Students transferring from another
major within the university (internal transfers) and students transferring from another institution
(external transfers) should meet with the department chair to discuss how previously completed
courses will fit into the major and to develop a plan of study.
RETENTION PROCEDURES

The retention of students is critical to the department. Faculty advising, tutoring, and counseling
services support this effort.

Faculty Advisors
The cornerstone for the retention of students in the Counseling & Human Services Department is
the faculty advisor, who is important in helping each student achieve his or her personal and
career goals. Upon admission to the department, each student is assigned an advisor who is a
Counseling & Human Services faculty member. Faculty advisors assist in course planning and
are a source of information about the department and about the college in general. Although it is
the responsibility of the student to become familiar with academic regulations presented in
university publications, the advisor can provide background knowledge and assistance, with
emphasis on the student’s own decision-making. Advisors schedule weekly office hours and are
available for individually requested appointments.
Tutoring (The Academic Link)
The Academic Link, nationally certified by the College Reading and Learning Association, serves
as Stevenson University’s tutoring and academic assistance center, offering free tutoring in most
courses to all enrolled students. Students work with dedicated peer and faculty tutors as a team
to learn effective study strategies, increase understanding of course content, and become
independent learners. The Link’s web site (http://academiclink.stevensonuniversity.org/) lists
many of the services and resources available.
Counseling Services
From time to time, most people go through stages of growth that present unique and challenging
decisions. The Wellness Center provides a wide variety of services, in both group and individual
settings, to aid members of the student community in clarifying personal concerns and reaching
decisions. Counselors, who are trained, objective professionals, are available to assist students
by providing an opportunity to talk and receive feedback in a setting that is confidential and
comfortable.

DISMISSAL PROCEDURES

Satisfactory performance in CHS 380 (internship and accompanying seminar) is required for the
practicum (CHS 440). Unsatisfactory performance (a grade below C) in CHS 380 will result in
25

ineligibility for CHS 440. Students whose performance in CHS 380 is unsatisfactory are
permitted to repeat the course. A second grade below C in CHS 380 will result in dismissal from
the major.
In order to be eligible for the practicum (CHS 440), students must have a 2.5 overall GPA and
demonstrate adequate professionalism, as assessed by faculty. Any concerns related to meeting
professional expectations will be communicated to students (see next section). Students who do
not meet professional expectations, or have below a 2.5 GPA by the end of the semester before
their practicum placement, will not be allowed to register for CHS 440 and may need to switch
majors.
ETHICS

Professional integrity is essential. Ethical behavior is expected and required of students both in
their academic work and in their field work.
Academic Honesty
To promote the free exchange of ideas, the Stevenson University community depends upon the
academic honesty of all of its members. While acknowledging that the vast majority of students
conduct themselves with a fundamental honesty, the college seeks to set the highest ethical
standards. For students, academic honesty is merely a prelude to the personal integrity and
professional ethics that will govern their careers. All forms of academic dishonesty (including,
but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized assistance, fabrication, and multiple
submissions) are subject to the sanctions stipulated in the University’s Student Policy Manual.
Ethics in Field Work
Ethical behavior in the field involves making sound decisions concerning issues such as
confidentiality. Information regarding clients/personnel must be kept confidential and shared
only in an appropriate professional context. Confidentiality is a significant aspect of
professionalism and must be maintained at all times. Standards that address confidentiality and
other ethical issues are contained in the code of standards of the National Organization for
Human Services (Please see Appendix).

SECTION III:
Field Placement Information

27

OVERVIEW OF FIELD PLACEMENTS
Internship
During their junior year, students spend 90 hours (two mornings a week or two afternoons a
week) participating in a field experience in a non-profit, human services setting (CHS 380). This
placement provides students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills they have
learned in the program. Concurrently, they explore professional issues in a seminar that meets
one hour each week. The internship is an important precursor to the practicum, which is a much
more extensive and intensive experience.
In the fall of their junior year, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to determine
eligibility and to discuss placement interests. The Field Placement Coordinator then suggests
appropriate agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Practicum
During their senior year, students spend a full semester in a 9-credit (410 hours) field experience
in a professional human services setting (CHS 440). Like the internship, the practicum
experience allows students to apply the knowledge and skills learned throughout the program. In
the practicum, students function much like entry level staff members and are valued members of
service teams. Concurrently, students enroll in CHS 441, a 3-credit course entitled Seminar in
Human Services. The seminar provides students an opportunity to discuss and reflect upon
issues that may arise during the practicum. Topics that are covered include the role of the
student in a professional setting as well as issues that pertain to the field of human services.
Students develop personal learning objectives and document progress toward meeting the
objectives by journaling with their faculty supervisor. As part of the seminar, students augment
individual portfolios developed in prior human services courses and present a discussion of their
experience at the end of the semester. Additional assignments may be required for the courses or
from the human services agency.
In the fall or spring of their senior year, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to
determine eligibility and to discuss placement interests. The Field Placement Coordinator then
suggests an appropriate agency or agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Guidelines
All placements must be approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. If currently employed at a
human services agency, students may not complete their internship or practicum as part of their
current position of employment, but may arrange for a separate and distinct field placement
experience within the agency, if approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. A limited number
of agencies may offer paid field placements. Such placements are acceptable with the approval of
the Field Placement Coordinator.

ETHICAL STANDARDS FOR HUMAN SERVICES
PROFESSIONALS
National Organization for Human Services, Adopted 2015
Preamble
Human services is a profession developed in response to the direction of human needs and human
problems in the 1960’s. Characterized by an appreciation of human beings in all of their diversity,
human services offers assistance to its clients within the context of their communities and
environments. Human service professionals and those who educate them promote and encourage
the unique values and characteristics of human services. In so doing, human service professionals
uphold the integrity and ethics of the profession, promote client and community well-being, and
enhance their own professional growth.
The fundamental values of the human services profession include respecting the dignity and
welfare of all people; promoting self-determination; honoring cultural diversity; advocating for
social justice; and acting with integrity, honesty, genuineness and objectivity.
Human service professionals consider these standards in ethical and professional decision
making. Conflicts may exist between this code and laws, workplace policies, cultural practices,
credentialing boards, and personal beliefs. Ethical-decision making processes should be employed
to assure careful choices. Although ethical codes are not legal documents, they may be used to
address issues related to the behavior of human service professionals.
Persons who use this code include members of the National Organization for Human Services,
students in relevant academic degree programs, faculty in those same programs, researchers,
administrators, and professionals in community agencies who identify with the profession of
human services. The ethical standards are organized in sections around those persons to whom
ethical practice should be applied.

Responsibility to Clients
STANDARD 1 Human service professionals recognize and build on client and community
strengths.
STANDARD 2 Human service professionals obtain informed consent to provide services to
clients at the beginning of the helping relationship. Clients should be informed that they may
withdraw consent at any time except where denied by court order and should be able to ask
questions before agreeing to the services. Clients who are unable to give consent should have
those who are legally able to give consent for them review an informed consent statement and
provide appropriate consent.
STANDARD 3 Human service professionals protect the client's right to privacy and
confidentiality except when such confidentiality would cause serious harm to the client or others,
when agency guidelines state otherwise, or under other stated conditions (e.g., local, state, or
federal laws). Human service professionals inform clients of the limits of confidentiality prior to
the onset of the helping relationship.

35

STANDARD 4 If it is suspected that danger or harm may occur to the client or to others as a
result of a client's behavior, the human service professional acts in an appropriate and
professional manner to protect the safety of those individuals. This may involve, but is not limited
to, seeking consultation, supervision, and/or breaking the confidentiality of the relationship.
STANDARD 5 Human service professionals recognize that multiple relationships may increase
the risk of harm to or exploitation of clients and may impair their professional judgment. When it
is not feasible to avoid dual or multiple relationships, human service professionals should
consider whether the professional relationship should avoided or curtailed.
STANDARD 6 Sexual or romantic relationships with current clients are prohibited. Before
engaging in sexual or romantic relationships with former clients, friends, or family members of
former clients, human service professionals carefully evaluate potential exploitation or harm and
refrain from entering into such a relationship.
STANDARD 7 Human service professionals ensure that their values or biases are not imposed
upon their clients.
STANDARD 8 Human service professionals protect the integrity, safety, and security of client
records. Client information in written or electronic form that is shared with other professionals
must have the client’s prior written consent except in the course of professional supervision or
when legally obliged or permitted to share such information.
STANDARD 9 When providing services through the use of technology, human service
professionals take precautions to ensure and maintain confidentiality and comply with all relevant
laws and requirements regarding storing, transmitting, and retrieving data. In addition, human
service professionals ensure that clients are aware of any issues and concerns related to
confidentiality, service issues, and how technology might negatively or positively impact the
helping relationship.

Responsibility to the Public and Society
STANDARD 10 Human service professionals provide services without discrimination or
preference in regards to age, ethnicity, culture, race, ability, gender, language preference, religion,
sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, nationality, or other historically oppressed groups.
STANDARD 11 Human service professionals are knowledgeable about the cultures and
communities within which they practice. They are aware of multiculturalism in society and its
impact on the community as well as individuals within the community. They respect the cultures
and beliefs of individuals and groups.
STANDARD 12 Human service professionals are aware of local, state, and federal laws. They
advocate for change in regulations and statutes when such legislation conflicts with ethical
guidelines and/or client rights. Where laws are harmful to individuals, groups, or communities,
human service professionals consider the conflict between the values of obeying the law and the
values of serving people and may decide to initiate social action.
STANDARD 13 Human service professionals stay informed about current social issues as they
affect clients and communities. If appropriate to the helping relationship, they share this
information with clients, groups and communities as part of their work.

36

STANDARD 14 Human service professionals are aware of social and political issues that
differentially affect clients from diverse backgrounds.
STANDARD 15 Human service professionals provide a mechanism for identifying client needs
and assets, calling attention to these needs and assets, and assisting in planning and mobilizing to
advocate for those needs at the individual, community, and societal level when appropriate to the
goals of the relationship.
STANDARD 16 Human service professionals advocate for social justice and seek to eliminate
oppression. They raise awareness of underserved population in their communities and with the
legislative system.
STANDARD 17 Human service professionals accurately represent their qualifications to the
public. This includes, but is not limited to, their abilities, training, education, credentials,
academic endeavors, and areas of expertise. They avoid the appearance of misrepresentation or
impropriety and take immediate steps to correct it if it occurs.
STANDARD 18 Human service professionals describe the effectiveness of treatment
programs, interventions and treatments, and/or techniques accurately, supported by data
whenever possible.

Responsibility to Colleagues
STANDARD 19 Human service professionals avoid duplicating another professional's helping
relationship with a client. They consult with other professionals who are assisting the client in a
different type of relationship when it is in the best interest of the client to do so. In addition,
human services professionals seek ways to actively collaborate and coordinate with other
professionals when appropriate.
STANDARD 20 When human service professionals have a conflict with a colleague, they first
seek out the colleague in an attempt to manage the problem. If this effort fails, the professional
then seeks the assistance of supervisors, consultants, or other professionals in efforts to address
the conflict.
STANDARD 21 Human service professionals respond appropriately to unethical and
problematic behavior of colleagues. Usually this means initially talking directly with the
colleague and if no satisfactory resolution is achieved, reporting the colleague's behavior to
supervisory or administrative staff.
STANDARD 22 All consultations between human service professionals are kept private, unless
to do so would result in harm to clients or communities.

Responsibility to Employers
STANDARD 23 To the extent possible, human service professionals adhere to commitments
made to their employers.
STANDARD 24 Human service professionals participate in efforts to establish and maintain
employment conditions which are conducive to high quality client services. Whenever
possible, they assist in evaluating the effectiveness of the agency through reliable and valid
assessment measures.

37

STANDARD 25 When a conflict arises between fulfilling the responsibility to the employer and
the responsibility to the client, human service professionals work with all involved to manage
the conflict.

Responsibility to the Profession
STANDARD 26 Human service professionals seek the training, experience, education and
supervision necessary to ensure their effectiveness in working with culturally diverse individuals
based on age, ethnicity, culture, race, ability, gender, language preference, religion, sexual
orientation, socioeconomic status, nationality, or other historically oppressive groups. In
addition, they will strive to increase their competence in methods which are known to be the best
fit for the population(s) with whom they work.
STANDARD 27 Human service professionals know the limit and scope of their professional
knowledge and offer services only within their knowledge, skill base, and scope of practice.
STANDARD 28 Human service professionals seek appropriate consultation and supervision
to assist in decision-making when there are legal, ethical or other dilemmas.
STANDARD 29 Human service professionals promote cooperation among related disciplines to
foster professional growth and to optimize the impact of inter-professional collaboration on
clients at all levels.
STANDARD 30 Human service professionals promote the continuing development of their
profession. They encourage membership in professional associations, support research
endeavors, foster educational advancement, advocate for appropriate legislative actions, and
participate in other related professional activities.
STANDARD 31 Human service professionals continually seek out new and effective
approaches to enhance their professional abilities and use techniques that are conceptually or
evidence based. When practicing techniques that are experimental or new, they inform clients of
the status of such techniques as well as the possible risks.
STANDARD 32 Human service professionals conduct research that adheres to all ethical
principles, institutional standards, and scientific rigor. Such research takes into consideration
cross-cultural bias and is reported in a manner that addressed any limitations.
STANDARD 33 Human service professionals make careful decisions about disclosing personal
information while using social media, knowing that they reflect the profession of human
services. In addition, they consider how their public conduct may reflect on themselves and their
profession.

Responsibility to Self
STANDARD 34 Human service professionals are aware of their own cultural backgrounds,
beliefs, values, and biases. They recognize the potential impact of their backgrounds on their
relationships with others and work diligently to provide culturally competent service to all of their
clients.
STANDARD 35 Human service professionals strive to develop and maintain healthy personal
growth to ensure that they are capable of giving optimal services to clients. When they find that

38

they are physically, emotionally, psychologically, or otherwise not able to offer such services,
they identify alternative services for clients.
STANDARD 36 Human service professionals hold a commitment to lifelong learning and
continually advance their knowledge and skills to serve clients more effectively.

Responsibility to Students
STANDARD 37 Human service educators develop and implement culturally sensitive
knowledge, awareness, and teaching methodologies.
STANDARD 38 Human service educators are committed to the principles of access and
inclusion and take all available and applicable steps to make education available to
differently-abled students.
STANDARD 39 Human service educators demonstrate high standards of scholarship in their
scholarship, pedagogy, and professional service and stay current in the field by being members
of their professional associations, attending workshops and conferences, and reviewing and/or
conducting research.
STANDARD 40 Human service educators recognize and acknowledge the contributions of
students to the work of the educator in such activities as case material, grants, workshops,
research, publications, and other related activities.
STANDARD 41 Human service educators monitor students' field experiences to ensure the
quality of the placement site, supervisory experience, and learning experience towards the goals
of personal, professional, academic, career, and civic development. When students experience
potentially harmful events during field placements, educators provide reasonable investigation
and response as necessary to safeguard the student.
STANDARD 42 Human service educators establish and uphold appropriate guidelines concerning
student disclosure of sensitive/personal information which includes letting students have fair
warning of any self-disclosure activities, allowing students to opt-out of in-depth self-disclosure
activities when feasible, and ensuring that a mechanism is available to discuss and process such
activities as needed.
STANDARD 43 Human service educators are aware that in their relationships with students,
power and status are unequal. Human service educators are responsible to clearly define and
maintain ethical and professional relationships with student; avoid conduct that is demeaning,
embarrassing or exploitative of students; and always strive to treat students fairly, equally and
without discrimination.
STANDARD 44 Human service educators ensure students are familiar with, informed by, and
accountable to the ethical standards and policies put forth by their program/department, the
course syllabus/instructor, their advisor(s), and the Ethical Standards of Human Service
Professionals.

that outlines the courses in these areas of concentration can be found on the following
page.
The curriculum incorporates theory, research, and application, with field experience as a
crucial part of the courses. In addition to the required courses, students choose five
focused electives that allow them to tailor the program to meet their individual needs and
interests. These electives are courses that have been approved by faculty members in the
program as being relevant to a career in human services but are not program
requirements.
Students may pursue a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts degree in Counseling &
Human Services. The Bachelor of Arts degree requires the completion of at least two
courses in a foreign language at the intermediate level or above.

CHS 440 PRACTICUM IN HUMAN SERVICES
(410-hour field experience)
CHS 441 SEMINAR IN HUMAN SERVICES

Handbook TOC

OVERVIEW OF FIELD PLACEMENTS
Internship
During their junior year, students spend 90 hours (two mornings a week or two
afternoons a week) participating in a field experience in a non-profit, human services
setting (CHS 380). This placement provides students with the opportunity to apply the
knowledge and skills they have learned in the program. Concurrently, they explore
professional issues in a seminar that meets one hour each week. The internship is an
important precursor to the practicum, which is a much more extensive and intensive
experience.
In the fall of their junior year, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to
determine eligibility and to discuss placement interests. The Field Placement
Coordinator then suggests appropriate agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Practicum
During their senior year, students spend a full semester in a 9-credit (410 hours) field
experience in a non-profit, human services setting (CHS 440). Like the internship, the
practicum experience allows students to apply the knowledge and skills learned
throughout the program. In the practicum, students function much like entry level staff
members and are valued members of service teams. Concurrently, students enroll in CHS
441, a 3-credit course entitled Seminar in Human Services. The seminar provides
students an opportunity to discuss and reflect upon issues that may arise during the
practicum. Topics that are covered include the role of the student in a professional setting
as well as issues that pertain to the field of human services.
Students develop personal learning objectives and document progress toward meeting the
objectives by journaling with their faculty supervisor. As part of the seminar, students
augment individual portfolios developed in prior human services courses and present a
discussion of their experience at the end of the semester. Additional assignments may be
required for the courses or from the human services agency.
At the beginning of the semester before starting a practicum, students meet with the Field
Placement Coordinator to establish eligibility, discuss placement interests, and develop a
list of appropriate agencies for students to contact for an interview. Student eligibility is
assessed by the department, according to the criteria below, at the end of each semester
with final eligibility determined at the end of the semester before the practicum starts.
Guidelines
All placements must be approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. If currently
employed at a human services agency, students may not complete their internship or
practicum as part of their current position of employment, but may arrange for a separate
and distinct field placement experience within the agency, if approved by the Field
Placement Coordinator. A limited number of agencies may offer paid field placements.
Such placements are acceptable with the approval of the Field Placement Coordinator.

RESOLUTION OF FIELD PLACEMENT ISSUES
A field placement is usually a positive experience both for the student and for the agency.
Occasionally, however, the placement does not fulfill the student’s needs and/or the
agency’s needs. In the event of problems in the field, the following procedure should be
followed:
1.​ It is important to remember that the field instructor and the student share the
responsibility for identifying and dealing with problems as soon as they become
evident. It is crucial for the field instructor and the student to maintain open
communication and for the student to see the presenting problem as an
opportunity to learn more about his/her learning style and interpersonal skills.
2.​ The student and the field instructor should attempt to resolve the problem
together. If the attempt is not successful, they should inform each other of their
intention to seek additional help.
3.​ Both the student and the field instructor should notify the university supervisor,
who will obtain the assistance of the Field Placement Coordinator.
4. ​ One meeting will be held with the field instructor and the student to see if ​
adaptations beneficial to both parties could occur. The university supervisor will ​
mediate this discussion and determine whether the resolution process needs to ​
continue.
5. ​Effort will be made to maintain the placement. Occasionally, however, the ​
coordinator may decide that it is necessary to remove a student from a particular ​
placement. The reasons for this action range from inadequate supervision on the ​
part of the agency to a violation of the Code of Ethics on the part of the student.
6. ​ If a placement is terminated, the Coordinator will examine the situation to ​
determine whether an alternative placement will be made.

FIELD PLACEMENT PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES
47

1.​ Attendance Procedures
A.​ Excessive lateness will impair the student's ability to meet course
objectives. Therefore, students are expected to be on time.
B.​ Students must notify both the field instructor and university supervisor of
any absence prior to the experience. Students who miss more than one
day of their placement must make up the placement time. However,
students are not required to make up hours missed if the placement site is
closed and the student is not required to report; missed hours may not
constitute more than 10% of the overall required hours.
C.​ Students must document the hours spent at the internship or practicum by
completing a time accountability sheet. Use the SU form unless otherwise
required by the site.
D.​ A student having a major accident, illness or surgery, must submit to the
university supervisor a physician’s note.
E.​ Interns and practicum students are entitled to observe their own religious
holidays.
F.​ Vacation guidelines
1. Interns should follow the University’s calendar for holidays and
vacations.
​ 2. Students in a practicum should follow the agency’s calendar, including ​
holidays and vacations.
G. Students should be flexible and attend activities at alternate locations if
they fall on a placement day.
H.​ Students must be on site at their placements no fewer than 12 weeks
within the officially designated beginning and ending of a semester.
4.​ Agency Requirements
Students must participate in any requirements of the agency in which they
are placed. They may include but are not limited to training sessions,
orientation sessions, and background checks, which may include
fingerprinting. In addition, students may need to show proof of
immunizations received and receive any necessary immunizations.
5.​ Dress Code Guidelines
During the internship and practicum, students must maintain a
professional appearance at all times. The students are responsible for
following the dress code policies of the agency.

6.​ Transportation and Parking

48

Students are expected to arrange transportation for themselves either
through private or public means. Students are responsible for all
transportation expenses, including gas and parking fees. Travel time to
and from the agency is not considered for placements.
7.​ Confidentiality
Confidentiality is extremely important when working with clients and
families in the community. Students are expected to adhere to a strict code
of confidentiality. Students must handle all personal information about
clients, families and the agency in a confidential manner.
8.​ Special Issues
When questions or concerns arise regarding the placement, students
should discuss them with the field instructor and/or the faculty supervisor,
as appropriate. When in doubt, always discuss the issue with the faculty
supervisor.
9.​

Employment
Faculty members in the department believe that the student should NOT
attempt to be employed during the practicum. If already employed at a
human services agency, the student may not complete their practicum as
part of their current position of employment, but may arrange for a
separate and distinct field placement experience within the agency, if
approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. A limited number of
agencies may offer paid field placements. Such placements are acceptable
with the approval of the Field Placement Coordinator.
The practicum requires much energy and time. It is a rewarding
experience but at the same time tiring, due to the number of hours
committed to the agency and requirements. If a student’s financial
situation requires that he/she work, please consider the following options:

​
​
​

Try to save money in advance so that you will not need to work during
your final semester.
Apply for additional loans so that you will not need to work.
Apply for additional financial assistance/scholarships from the Financial
Aid Office.
If, after exploring the above options, the student decides that he/she must ​
work, limit working hours to the weekend so that during the week the ​
student can prepare appropriately and get much needed rest.
