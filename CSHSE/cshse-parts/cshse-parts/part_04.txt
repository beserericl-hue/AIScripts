The reflection on professional self (e.g., journaling, development of a portfolio, or project
demonstrating competency) is emphasized throughout the Counseling & Human Services
Program. It is specifically addressed through in-class activities and discussions, lecture, in-class
media presentation, assigned reading and out-of-class activities in the following human services
classes: CHS 105, 224, 340, 430, 380, 440 and 441.
Students complete a Professional Portfolio project throughout their curriculum. They begin the
portfolio in CHS 217, developing a resume and describing agencies they have visited. In CHS
380 they add to the portfolio based on self-assessment inventories and their experiences in
Internship. The portfolio is completed in CHS 441 and it designed to reflect their professional
accomplishments and personal insights throughout the program.
CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy course objectives include: 4) “describe how
personal, ethical, and legal issues affect the delivery of human services” and 6) “specify how
his/her personal values and goals relate to a career in human services”. In addition, reflection
on professional self is explored through assigned readings, lecture, and in-class activities
specifically related to the role of self in establishing a helping relationship.
In CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, students complete a project demonstrating
competency that reflects their professional self when they develop a detailed research proposal
related to an aspect of the human services field.
In CHS 340 Administration of Human Services, students complete two projects related to
professional self: they work as a group to design a strategic plan and they write a formal
proposal seeking resources (Course Requirements 2 and 6).
The CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions course objectives include the expectations
that the student be able to 2)“articulate how one’s family history influences perceptions of
family processes” and 5) “demonstrate sensitivity to differences in family structure and social,
economic and cultural background.” Related assignments, readings, lecture, and media
presentations are designed to promote reflection on professional self (Family of Origin Project).

CHS 380 Internship, 440 Practicum, and 441 Seminar involve class or seminar experiences and
field placement experiences in which the reflection on professional self is learned and practiced.
Objective 2 of the CHS 380 course is that the students “analyze their own natural style of
helping and its impact”. Students in the CHS 380 course use journaling, portfolios, and a
substantial Reflection Paper which incorporates several self-assessment tools to broaden and
explore their reflection on professional self (Course Requirements 3, 4, and 5). The journaling,
discussions, readings, issue presentation, lecture, professional portfolio, and poster presentation
of the CHS 441 course are also designed to promote reflection on professional self.

B. Field Experience
Context: Field experience such as a practicum or internship occurs in a human services setting.
Fieldwork provides an environment and context to integrate the knowledge, theory, skills, and
professional behaviors that are concurrently being taught in the classroom. It must be an integral part
of the education process.
Standard 21: The program shall provide field experience that is integrated with the curriculum.
Specifications for Standard 21:
Table of Contents
As evidence of meeting this standard, programs must:
a.

Provide a brief description of the overall process and structure of the fieldwork learning
experience.
Response: (See Field Placement Handbook)
Internship During their junior year, students spend 90 hours (two mornings a week or two
afternoons a week) participating in a field experience in a professional human services setting
(CHS 380 Internship). This placement provides students with the opportunity to apply the
knowledge and skills they have learned in the program. Concurrently, they explore professional
issues in a seminar that meets one hour each week. The internship is an important precursor to
the practicum, which is a much more extensive and intensive experience. In the fall of their
junior year, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to determine eligibility and to
discuss placement interests. The Field Placement Coordinator then suggests appropriate
agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Practicum During their senior year, students spend a full semester in a 9-credit (410 hours) field
experience in a professional human services setting (CHS 440 Practicum). [Note the 12-credit
hour option (540 hours) was recently eliminated, since it was determined that the extra hours
did not add to the value of the experience, but did add significantly to student stress levels. Some
students who entered the program under the previous curriculum are still completing the
12-credit practicum, but most are being advised into the 9-credit practicum.] Like the
internship, the practicum experience allows students to apply the knowledge and skills learned
throughout the program. In the practicum, students function much like entry level staff
members and are valued members of service teams. Concurrently, students enroll in CHS 441, a
3-credit course entitled Seminar in Counseling & Human Services. The seminar provides
students an opportunity to discuss and reflect upon issues that may arise during the practicum.
Topics that are covered include the role of the student in a professional setting as well as issues
that pertain to the field of human services.
Students develop personal learning objectives and document progress toward meeting the
objectives by journaling with their faculty supervisor. As part of the seminar, students augment
individual portfolios developed in prior human services courses and present a discussion of their
experience at the end of the semester. Additional assignments may be required for the courses
or from the human services agency.

The semester before Practicum, students meet with the Field Placement Coordinator to
determine eligibility and to discuss placement interests. The Field Placement Coordinator then
suggests an appropriate agency or agencies for students to contact for an interview.
Guidelines All placements must be approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. If currently
employed at a human services agency, students may not complete their internship or practicum
as part of their current position of employment, but may arrange for a separate and distinct field
placement experience within the agency, if approved by the Field Placement Coordinator. A
limited number of agencies may offer paid field placements. Such placements are acceptable
with the approval of the Field Placement Coordinator.
Written Learning Contract. A written learning contract for each student is developed and
agreed to by the student, the University, and the field instructor. Through their seminar
experiences, students are encouraged to write learning objectives in behavioral terms that
describe specific actions and activities. Field instructors collaborate with the students in writing
the objectives, and the University Supervisor approves them.
Student Field Placement Evaluation. Students in field placements are guided and evaluated by
their field instructors and by themselves using the Student Field Placement Evaluation. The
field placement evaluation tool consists of six goals, which are also the goals of the Program.
Each goal is accompanied by a list of behavioral objectives. Goals and objectives are evaluated
as “Below”, “Meets”, or “Exceeds” Expectations, and evaluators have space to comment on
each goal or objective if desired.
Students and field instructors each complete the evaluation tool midway through the semester
and at the end of the semester. Field instructors write overall comments at midpoint, and both
field instructors and faculty supervisors write overall, final comments. In addition, field
instructors recommend a grade of Pass or Fail at the end of the semester. The University
Supervisor, however, has the final say in determining a student’s grade.
In creating the Student Field Placement Evaluation, we attempted to make it uncomplicated for
the field instructor to fill out and, at the same time, comprehensive enough to provide in-depth
information about the student’s performance in his or her field placement. Information from
students, field instructors, and advisory board members was instrumental in its development.
Comments from field instructors, the Advisory Board, and faculty members indicate that the
tool is user friendly both for those who are making the evaluations and for those who are
interpreting the results. This spring the evaluation was modified slightly to reflect revised
program goals.
Agency Evaluation by Student. Students in field placements evaluate their placement sites by
using the Agency Evaluation by Student. This tool consists of 9 criteria to which students
respond Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree, or Not Enough Data to Evaluate.
Four additional items permit students to comment on additional aspects of the agency. Finally,
students are asked whether they would recommend the placement to another student.

Students complete the tool at the end of their field experience and submit it to the University
Supervisor who, in turn, gives it to the Field Placement Coordinator. Please see Appendix 4 for
a copy of the instrument, or click here (students complete the survey online).
University Supervisor Evaluation by Student. Students in field placements evaluate their
University Supervisors. This tool consists of 13 criteria to which students respond Strongly
Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree, or No Opinion. A section for Additional Comments
and/or Suggestions is provided. See Appendix 8, or click here (students complete the survey
online).
b.

Provide evidence that one academic credit is awarded for no less than three hours of field
experience per week.
Response:
Students are granted academic credits for field placements. The number of credits is contingent
upon the number of field work hours. One credit hour is the equivalent of 3 hours of field work
per week for 15 weeks (one semester). Thus, students who participate in the internship of 90
hours (six hours per week for 15 weeks) receive two credit hours (plus one credit for meeting in
class one hour per week). Students who participate in the practicum of 410 hours (27 hours per
week for 15 weeks) receive 9 credit hours, and students who participate in the practicum of 540
hours (36 hours per week for 15 weeks) receive 12 credit hours [the 540 hour option is being
eliminated for entering students].

c.

Demonstrate that students are exposed to human services agencies and clients (assigned
visitation, observation, assisting staff, etc.) early in the program.
Response:
Field experiences are an integral part of each student’s total educational process. Their format
and duration vary according to the particular student’s status in the program.
Students’ exposures to agencies begin early in the program, when, as a requirement for CHS
217 Professional Development in Counseling & Human Services, students visit two different
human services agencies and interview a human service worker at each agency. In addition to
the information collected during the interview, students are encouraged to tour the agencies and
collect written documents (e.g., brochures, pamphlets, printed forms) describing the facility
which can be shared in class. Students present oral and written reports about their agencies.
Some type of field experience is incorporated into most courses in the program. For example,
students in CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence interview and write about someone
who is part of a family that relates to a topic the class is discussing, such as a person who is an
immigrant or whose parent/parents have immigrated to the United States. Each student in CHS
360 Counseling Strategies for Individuals conducts an interview with a “client” and submits an
audio recording and a systematic analysis of the interview.
Although not a requirement of the program, many human services students receive direct
exposure to agencies through their participation in the Human Services Club. As part of their
involvement in the club, students are responsible for both organizing and participating in
various activities such as the Stevenson University Fair, and the Johns Hopkins University
Children’s House, which provides housing for the families of critically ill children.

d.

Provide a copy of the current manual and guidelines that are given to students advising them of
field placement requirements and policies.
Response:
The Field Placement Handbook, which each student receives before participating in a field
placement, includes all necessary information pertaining to the field placement and thus
functions as a field work manual. The Field Placement Handbook is revised on a yearly basis.
Information about field placements, including prerequisites, can also be found in the CHS
Student Handbook.

e.

Provide documentation of written learning agreements with field agencies that specify the
student’s role, activities, anticipated learning outcomes, supervision, and field instruction. The
agreement must be signed by the appropriate agency director, fieldwork supervisor, program
instructor, and student.
Response:
A list of agencies where students complete field placements is in the Appendix. Most of the
agencies do not require a formal contract, but sample agreements with Kennedy Krieger
Institute and Sheppard Pratt, two of our larger field placement sites, are included. These
agreements have not changed in the past five years. A more recent agreement with Baltimore
County DSS is here. Upon the placement of a student with an agency, the Field Placement
Coordinator sends a letter of agreement to the agency confirming the placement and
summarizing expectations, along with a copy of the Field Placement Handbook, which
discusses all aspects of the field placement.

f.

Provide syllabi for required seminars. Seminars must meet no less than every two weeks.
Seminar hours must not be included in field experience hours.
Response:
See syllabi for CHS 380 Internship and CHS 441 Seminar. Students meet in class weekly in
CHS 380 and at least every other week in CHS 441 Seminar (for Practicum).

g.

Provide evidence that required field experience is no less than 350 (may include 250 from
associate level) clock hours of field experience with at least 100 of these clock hours occurring
in the junior and senior years.
Response:
During the junior year of the Program, students spend 90 hours participating in a field
experience in a human services setting as part of CHS 380 Internship. During the senior year of
the Program, students spend a full semester in a 9-credit (410 hours) or 12-credit (540 hours)
field experience as part of CHS 440 Practicum in Counseling & Human Services. Thus, their
total field experience hours will be at least 500 or 630 hours, all completed in their junior and
senior years (See syllabi for these courses).

h.

Demonstrate how the field experience provides the student an opportunity to progress from:
1.​ Observation to
2.​ Directly supervised client contact to
3.​ Indirectly supervised client contact to
4.​ An independent caseload OR assignment of administrative responsibility.
Response:
Both the Internship (CHS 380) and Practicum (CHS 440) experiences typically provide students
the opportunity to begin with observation and progress first to directly supervised client contact
and then to indirectly supervised client contact and finally to independent caseloads or

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

assignment of administrative responsibility. For example, one student’s practicum experience
was with the Baltimore County Department of Social Services’ Adoption and Foster Care Unit.
The student began by observing other workers’ interactions with clients, reading case files, and
talking with her co-workers. Next, she was supervised as she interacted with clients. During
the last two months of her field placement, she had the opportunity to have her own cases; in
particular, she worked very closely with two children in foster care/pre-adoptive placements. A
young female teen that she mentored responded very positively to her interventions, and an
emotionally disturbed 10-year old boy delighted in working on his Lifebook with her. The
student also supervised visitations between children and their birthparent(s).
Every semester, the Field Placement Coordinator reviews evaluations of placement sites
completed by students and summaries of their experiences in order to assess the nature of their
assignments and duties while at the site. The Field Placement Coordinator also reviews reports
submitted by University Supervisors based on their visits to sites. When new sites are acquired
or current sites fail to provide either an assignment of an independent caseload or assignment of
administrative responsibilities within the agency, the Field Placement Coordinator contacts the
site to ensure appropriate assignment of caseload or administrative responsibilities. Field
placement sites which are not able provide assignments of independent caseloads or
assignments of administrative responsibilities within the agency are removed from the catalog.
i.

Demonstrate that field supervisors have no less than the same degree the program awards. It is
strongly recommended that field supervisors have no less than one level of degree above the
level of degree awarded by the program.
Response:
All University Supervisors have no less than one degree above the level of certificate or degree
of the students they are supervising. A master’s degree is the minimum acceptable degree to be
a University Supervisor.

j.

Demonstrate that the program continually monitors the progress of each student and performs
no less than one site visit to each field placement site per quarter or semester. The visit can be
held as a direct site visit or with appropriate technology. The technology that is used should
ensure that the field placement supervisor and student can be identified.
Response:
For each student’s internship (CHS 380), the Field Placement Coordinator maintains open lines
of communication with field instructors and students. This person communicates with each
intern through his or her responses to the student’s periodic journal entries and through leading
the weekly internship seminar. Students in practicums (CHS 440) communicate on a weekly
basis through journal entries to an assigned University Supervisor and corresponding University
Supervisor replies. University supervisors attend some seminar meetings and may also
communicate by telephone with students in addition to their visit(s) to the site. At least one site
visit to meet with the student and field instructor is a requirement of University Supervisors.
Journal entries are required because of the power inherent in them. The Field Placement
Coordinator, University Supervisors and students have found journaling to be extremely helpful
to students in analyzing and processing their experiences. Their reflections allow students to
make connections between classroom information and their field experiences, and also between
what they’re doing in the field and actual learning. In addition, students’ journal entries allow

the Field Placement Coordinator and University Supervisor to assess the student’s ability to
meet course and personal objectives, and to communicate with students about their field
experiences.
Field instructors are given the Field Placement Coordinator’s and University Supervisor’s
telephone number at the beginning of the placement with instructions to telephone if needed.
University Supervisors visit the agency at the midpoint of the semester to confer with the
student and the field instructor a minimum of one time during the placement. With input from
the field instructor, the University supervisors evaluate the student’s overall performance and
provide a final course grade of “Pass” or “Fail”.
