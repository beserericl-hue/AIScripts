Agreement between Stevenson University and McDaniel College
Graduate Program
Human services majors at Stevenson University have the opportunity to complete their B.S. in
Human Services from Stevenson University and M.S. in Human Services Management from
McDaniel College in 5 years. Graduates will receive a Bachelor’s Degree in Human Services
from SU and a Master’s Degree in Human Services Management: Special Education from
McDaniel College.
The McDaniel Program provides graduate students with a master's degree while completing a
live-in internship as a Community Living Manager (CLM) in a residence for adults with
developmental disabilities. In return for their internship as CLMs, students receive a 75% tuition
scholarship, a stipend ($18,000 per year in 2010), full health care benefits, and free room and
board.
Students who intend to apply for the Master’s Program at McDaniel College should enroll in CHS
515 and CHS 540 instead of CHS 315 and CHS 340. Students who have been accepted into
McDaniel College’s Master’s Program in Human Services Management: Special Education may
enroll in McDaniel College’s EDU 550, Research Methodology, during their senior year at
Stevenson University. Accepted students participating in CHS 440 will be required to complete a
minimum of 50% of their field placement hours with Target Community and Educational
Services.
Juniors will receive additional information about the 5-year degree program in the CHS 380 class.
Interested students must submit (1) a letter of interest and (2) a recommendation by a full-time
faculty member in the SU Human Services Program. Minimum criteria for the program are (1)
2.75 GPA and (2) acquisition of a Bachelor’s Degree in Human Services prior to beginning the
fifth year of their graduate studies at McDaniel College.
If students transfer 6 credits (CHS 515 and CHS 540) and complete EDU 550 during their senior
year, they will be able to complete McDaniel College's Master's Program in Human Services
Management: Special Education in 1 year (6 credits-summer; 9 credits-fall, and 9 credits-spring).
Only courses in which the student earns a grade of “B” or better are eligible for transfer.
Graduates with a master’s degree in human services typically work as directors, managers, and
coordinators for non-profit agencies, usually working with children and adults with disabilities,
but also with the elderly population. Some work for state or federal government agencies, for
example, the Developmental Disabilities Administration or other state service providers.
The following indicates the transfer of course agreement between the B.S. in Human Services at
Stevenson University and the M.S. in Human Services Management in Special Education at
McDaniel College.

Issue Presentations
The personal enrichment of each student is central to Stevenson’s mission; “enlarging
one’s horizons and integrating one’s total capabilities” are key elements in the fulfillment
of the mission. In the following assignment your horizon will be enlarged as you learn
new information and then integrate it by thinking about it critically and reflecting upon it.
There are many controversial issues related to families. In this assignment, you will
investigate one of these issues by reading and preparing for but not conducting
fieldwork. After you have collected your data, you will present both sides of the issue to
the class in a team presentation. In an individual written report, you will summarize and
react to a journal article, discuss your fieldwork preparation, and reflect on your topic.
The issues to be presented and the team presentation posting dates are as follows
1. Is Healthcare a Right? ​ ​ ​
​

​

​

Apr. 18

2. Does Marriage Matter?​ ​ ​

2. Read at least one additional article on your topic from a scholarly journal. This article can be

not be a duplication of another team member's article. Your Article Review will be written
on your individual article and you must submit a link or electronic copy of your article.
3. In addition to reading about the issue you are investigating, I would like you to conduct some
field work to gather the thoughts and opinions of others. This could include interviewing
someone with professional or personal knowledge of the topic, or surveying other students.
CLASS PRESENTATION (Team Work)
All students working on a particular issue will post a presentation for the entire class to review.
In presenting your issue, it is important to present both sides. In addition, you should provide
information from your individual articles and your field work.
WRITTEN REPORT (Individual Work)
Reports should include the following sections and will generally be 3-5 pages long:
A. Article Review
1.​ Citation of article using APA style, including retrieval information.
2.​ Summary (Concise but thorough coverage of main points)
3.​ Evaluation (your analysis of the strengths, weaknesses and applicability of
the article)
B. Discussion of Field Work
1. Description of what you did or who you interviewed, including a copy of
your questions or survey.
2. Analysis/discussion of your results and how they relate to the issue.
C. Reflection on Your Issue - Based on your reading and field work, what are your own,
personal thoughts on this issue?
