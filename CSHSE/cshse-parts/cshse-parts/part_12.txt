GRADED ASSIGNMENTS & DUE DATES:
Readings/ Class Participation/Periodic Assignments (10 points each)
Advance preparation is mandatory, as students will be expected to synthesize, analyze, and evaluate the
readings in terms of academic knowledge as well as personal and professional experience. Grading will
take into consideration punctuality, consistency, completion of in-class and outside-class assignments,
expressive participation, and receptive participation.
Exams (100 points each) Feb 5, March 6, May Final TBA

There will be three in-class exams. Each will combine multiple-choice and essay questions. The
questions in these exams will be drawn from our class discussions and the assigned reading. These exams
will be non-cumulative.

GRADED ASSIGNMENTS & DUE DATES, cont.:
Research Proposal (200 points) April 29
Each student will write a research proposal that has potential for contributing to current knowledge in the student’s chosen
topic/interest. Students will develop this proposal, in stages, throughout the semester. Each part of the proposal may be
rewritten/improved using comments on the original version. Students are encouraged to maintain a folder for all their work in
this assignment. The details of this assignment & the grading rubric are provided in this syllabus.
Critical Review Papers (100 points) April 10
Each student will write a critical review paper of an assigned reading. This paper must be clearly divided into two sections with
the captions ‘summary’ and ‘critical comments’. Use the title of the article as title for this paper. The summary section of this
paper summarizes the article, highlighting the key points, issues raised, or conclusions arrived at by the author(s), and how the
research for the paper was done. The critical comments section should be written from the perspective of a research method
student, focusing on methodological and analytic issues. Students may also offer general critique of the material, pointing to the
strengths and weaknesses of the material including wrong assumptions, faulty or misleading conclusions, alternative
interpretations author(s) ignored, inconsistencies and contradictions in arguments/positions taken, organization and flow of the
material and expositional clarity. Conclude with your own thoughts on the material. The details of this assignment & the
grading rubric are provided in this syllabus. This assignment is worth 100 points, the same as a test grade.
Presentation (100 points) Weeks of April 29 & May 6
Students will be presenting their research proposals in class. They will demonstrate their grasp of the research process, share
insights on their topics from the research, speculate on the prospective contribution their research could make, highlight the
problems/limitations they anticipate and how they would overcome them. It is an opportunity for students to engage each other,
availing themselves the benefit of the knowledge produced by their individual research effort. This assignment is worth 100
points, the same as a test grade.
Regular class attendance and participation are necessary to pass and/or do well in this and indeed all courses. Students are
encouraged to be punctual and regular to class as class discussions are likely to draw on materials not covered by the assigned
readings. Various in-class assignments are worth 10 points.
If class is canceled due to the weather or other unforeseen reason, the lesson will be posted on Blackboard. It is the student’s
responsibility to check Blackboard and complete any posted assignments!
GUIDELINES and DUE DATES FOR THE RESEARCH PROPOSAL
Final Research Proposal = 200 Points

Assignment I: Topic Feb 15
To do research, in this case, write a research proposal, you need a topic – a general area of social study or
a social issue. A research topic is typically broad so allows the researcher, you, to develop it through the
steps of the research process, throughout the semester. Research is a rigorous, time and energy
consuming endeavor. As a result, topic selection should be done thoughtfully, paying utmost attention to
your interests. When you select a topic that interests you, it lightens the weight of the rigor involved in
doing research and you’re likely to complete the project.
Assignment II: Problem Statement and Research Questions Feb 20
Statement of Problem

First, explain what your general topic area is, touching on its different aspects, narrowing articulately to
your specific interest which, typically, is an aspect of your general topic area. Assuming your general
topic area is Domestic Violence, you offer a broad understanding of it, touching on its different aspects,
ending with the aspect that interests you most, the one you’ll study, say, Child Abuse. Next, explain why
your topic is worth studying – spell out the practical significance of your study – are there practical
problems about it that need to be understood or solved? Does the study have theoretical significance?
Research Questions
Use your topic to pose a question. This is your research question. For instance, using the Child Abuse
example, if the researcher identified ‘age of child’ as a factor, one may make a research question: Does
exposure to child abuse vary by the age of the child? Always pose the research question in such a way
that when you answer, it explains your topic or what happens to your topic.
Assignment III: Operationalization & Hypothesizing Feb 27
In this assignment, you think about your concepts and use them in making your research hypotheses.
Using teen pregnancy as an example:
Teenagers from 1-parent families are more likely than those from 2-parent families to be pregnant. OR
Teenage pregnancy will occur more among those from 1-parent families than those from 2-parent
families.
Assignment IV: Research Design April 3
This assignment should be completed as detailed below.
Topic: State your topic.
Data Collection:
Identify the study population, the population to whom your findings would apply. Explain how you
would collect data for your proposed study, identifying your technique by name. State how you would
select your sample, the sample selection technique you would use, how you would meet selection
requirements, if any, and your sample size.
Questionnaire
Construct a questionnaire, listing the questions/statements you will use to elicit responses to measure your
variables and test your hypotheses. Use closed-ended questions and describe how you would compute the
responses.
.
Assignment V: Literature Review DRAFT 1 March 25, DRAFT 2 April 15
The best way to can develop writing skills in writing literature reviews is to read others' literature reviews.
The write-up should reveal what is known about the topic generally, theoretically, and empirically, and the
variables in your proposal. Your reader should have a fair knowledge of what others have said or found
about your topic from the write-up. Organize the literature review by themes or subthemes. It’s a good
idea to use your variables as themes or subthemes. WHY IS THIS TOPIC RELEVANT/
IMPORTANT/NECESSARY? Remember to Use at least eight (8) primary sources.
Assignment VI: Conclusion (Limitations, Implications, Impact Assessment) and References April 24
Conclude your proposal by summarizing it, restating the necessity of your study, and speculating on the
potential methodological and/or analytic problems you would encounter if you were to carry out this
research and how you would overcome them. Conclude by speculating on the potential contribution your
research would make to our understanding of your topic if it were carried out. Include any insights this
project afforded you on your chosen topic. On a sheet of paper titled 'References', provide the details of

all the materials cited throughout the project. Use the APA style to organize and present all your
references.
REPORTS WILL BE PRESENTED IN CLASS AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER
Students will be presenting their research reports in class. They will demonstrate their grasp of the process and
share insights on their topics. This is an opportunity for students to engage each other, availing themselves the
benefit of the knowledge produced by their individual research effort.
Your grade for this presentation will equal 100 points, an exam grade.

COUNSELING AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT

GROUP COUNSELING (CHS 315/515)
PROCESS ANALYSIS PAPER
Paper
Apply your textbooks, as well as a minimum of 4 additional references, to your
experience in group. Your paper must address the stages of group, techniques and
practice, and specific group process concepts to the evolution of your individual
group. Do a process commentary on your group from both a leader’s and
member’s perspective. Apply your research on group process to an analysis of
your own experience in group. Conceptualize the group process, rather than give a
report of events. Incorporate your own experience of key themes in a way that
demonstrates your understanding of the readings by focusing on such points as the
following:
-​

What did you learn about yourself through this process?

-​

Focus on the qualities about yourself that might either enhance or detract
from your effectiveness as a group leader.

-​

Express concretely what this class taught you about being a group
member and a group leader, as well as what you learned about how
groups function, the stages of a group, and specific techniques to
facilitate the group process.

-​

What factors contribute to a working and productive group?

-​

When do groups get stuck, and how do they get “unstuck”?

-​

How can we best address resistance and anxiety in groups? What about
conflict?

-​

What have you learned in this class that you can apply to groups that you
will lead in the future?

-​

Describe your group and explain how your group did or did not fit the
characteristics described in the readings. ​

organization where you plan to do your practicum, one where you have worked or volunteered in
the past, the organization you created as a team in this class, or one where you would like to
work one day.
​
Overall, your goal is to develop a grant proposal to support one initiative within the

spaced pages, which address the initiative you choose. You will use the following format for
your proposal:

surveys, news media articles.
b.​ Simply interpret any data you obtain rather than just putting it in the
section.
c.​ Address what is the problem, what is the cause, why does it continue to
exist?
d.​ Use APA style when documenting resources
Reference page & in-text cites
●​ Goals (at least 1) These are broad, global descriptions of something you want to
accomplish over a period of time. They are idealistic and timeless and should inspire us.
●​ Objectives (Impact objectives) at least 3. These are clear, attainable and measurable and
time limited. Focus on results and begin with an action verb.
●​ Activities and Tasks: For each objective, what will be done, by whom and when.
●​ How you will evaluate – simple statement for each objective.

●​ A simple budget (Sample attached)
●​ Appendices:
1.​ Your mission statement
2.​ Your Impact chart
3.​ Your resume
4.​ Letters of personal endorsement or support of donating resources. (not included as
part of the 4 pages)
You will also present an overview of this proposal in class. Each student will have no
more than 5 minutes to present. Your audience will be your grant providers and you will
try to convey the importance of your request.
Grades will be based on:
Clarity of written organization: How is each section above addressed?
Research provided and use of APA style
Technical detail – spelling, grammar
Is there a compelling case for your request?
Oral presentation – is it clear and does it make sense??
Papers are due on the date of the presentation:
You will have time to work on this project in class – please bring your research
information for the Statement of Need to class. This class time can be used to ask
