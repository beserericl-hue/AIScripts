AAC By-Laws

Academic Affairs Committee
By-Laws
The purpose of the Academic Affairs Committee shall be to research, report on, and recommend to the
Faculty Council actions relevant to the academic standards of the university. All recommendations by
the committee to the Council shall be in writing.
The guiding philosophy of the AAC is threefold:
o​ Peer-Review: The AAC encourages collaboration across disciplines and schools so that the
entire institution contributes to and is aware of academic conversations, standards, and best
practices.
o​ Alignment: The AAC looks for a clear progression of measurable competencies from the
course objectives to the course level description to the track objectives to the program
outcomes so that the AAC can chart the progress of students from when they enter a program
to when they leave a program.
o​ Assessment: The AAC is more effective if it has accurate and current information about SU
programs, so the AAC encourages periodic Program Review presentations.
Article I
Membership
Section I. Eligibility
Members of the Committee shall be full-time faculty members and shall be appointed by their
respective schools. Members must serve at least two years on the committee, and no school shall elect
two new members in the same year. The appointment cycles must be staggered so that only one new
member from a school joins in the same year.
Section II. Proportionate Representation
Each school (Business, Education, Design, Sciences, Graduate and Professional Studies, and
Humanities and Social Sciences) shall appoint two full-time faculty members. A representative from
the library shall also sit on the committee.
Section III. Replacement
In case of frequent absences by any member, the chair, with the consent of a majority of the
Committee, shall fill the vacancy.

111

Article II
Officers
Chair: The chair’s duties shall be to preside at the meetings, to serve as official spokesperson for the
Committee, and to appoint a substitute Recording Chair in the event of the Recording Chair’s absence.
The Vice Chair: The vice- chair’s duties shall be to act in the place of the chair of the Committee
when the chair is unable to carry out any of the functions of the office of the chair.
The Recording Chair: The recording chair’s duties shall be to record the minutes of the meetings and
distribute summaries of these proceedings to members of the university community, and to carry on
the necessary correspondence for the Committee.
Article III
Meetings
Section 1. Regular Meetings
Regular meetings shall be held once a month during the allotted time for committee meetings on
campus.
Section 2. Special Meetings
Special meetings may be called by the Chair, especially around deadlines.
Section 3. Quorum
A majority of the Council’s membership shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business (7
members including the chair) at regular and special meetings.
Section 4. Minutes
A complete and permanent set of minutes for each meeting shall be kept electronically. The Chair
shall send a summary report of the business transacted to Faculty Council.
Section 5. Parliamentary Procedure
The committee has adopted Robert’s Rule of Order as the official guide for all deliberations.

112

Section 6. Voting
Voting shall be by voice, by show of hands, or by secret ballot when requested. A majority of those
present will carry the motion. Also, proposals submitted to the Committee shall be either accepted or
rejected. There shall be no “conditional acceptance” of a proposal. If a proposal is rejected, a list of
reasons shall be provided. If a proposal is rejected, it may be resubmitted after consulting your AAC
School Representative. Commentary may also accompany an accepted proposal.
As outlined in Robert’s Rules, there is no “friendly amendment.” Once the chair has stated a motion,
it is no longer the property of the mover. Any amendment, “friendly” or otherwise, must be adopted
by the Committee, either by vote or unanimous consent. If even one member objects, then the
amendment must be debated and voted on.
Section 7. Submission Guidelines
Guidelines and meeting dates shall be disseminated to all Deans, Program Coordinators, and faculty
members at the beginning of each academic year.
1.​

All proposals must meet the outlined criteria in the AAC Style Sheet and the AAC Course
Proposal Guidelines.

2.​

All proposals must be vetted by the appropriate process described in the AAC document
“Curricular Change Process.”

This step will serve as a motion “to approve,” but there will be no discussion until another AAC
Representative seconds the motion. If seconded, there will be a short 5-minute discussion (the
initial Representative may yield his or her time to another person to lead the brief discussion) and
vote. If un-seconded, the motion fails and there will be no further discussion.
3.​ The deadlines for new course proposals will be disseminated each August.
4. The deadline for submissions for a Friday meeting is 10:00 a.m. the preceding Monday.
​
Section 8. Program Review Presentation Policy
Because the AAC will be more effective if it has accurate and current information about SU programs,
the Program Review Presentations are solely for the AAC's edification and are in no way connected to
the overall assessment of any program.
Section 9. Alterations to Process, Form, and Guidelines
Any substantial alteration to a process, form or guideline will not take effect until the beginning of the
following semester in which the alteration was approved by the committee
