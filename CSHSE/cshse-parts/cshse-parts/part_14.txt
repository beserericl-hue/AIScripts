Course Requirements:
​

Exams:
The purpose of these exams is to assess your understanding of and ability to apply the material in this class. Some
questions will focus on assessing your knowledge and others will assess how well you can apply the information

you’ve learned in class to realistic situations. There will be three non-cumulative exams in this class. Each exam is
worth 100 points, and can consist of a combination of multiple choice and short answer questions.
Exam dates: All exams are on-line using Blackboard.
Standards for Written Assignments
APA style is the recommended format. Please, remember to properly footnote/reference ideas that are not your
own. Give the full reference of the research article (author, year, title, journal name, volume, pages) using APA
style. Help with references can be found at the Purdue Online Writing Lab
(http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/) and at the American Psychological Association website
(http://www.apastyle.org/index.aspx).
All assignments need to be double-spaced, 12 point Times New Roman font, with 1 inch margins on all sides.
Please include a cover page and a reference page, with in-text citations (where applicable). Points may be
deducted if this format is not followed. In general, you should work on content in your first draft and then
consider organization and style as you move through the drafting and writing process and, of course, careful
proofreading and editing.
Homework Assignments:
1.​ Reading Anticipation Guides (RA): Before reading each chapter, you will be required to complete the RAG for
that chapter. You will need to turn it in at the beginning of the class where we are scheduled to start
discussing that chapter. Please fill this out by hand as opposed to typing it on the computer. DUE: at the
beginning of each class when topic will be discussed.
2.​ NOBA Module Quiz: In most of the on-line modules there is a mastery quiz. The mastery approach gives you
the opportunity to practice retrieving the information from the module over a series of retests. The more you
do the better you are likely to do on the exam. For this class you must complete the quiz with 20 items AT
LEAST ONCE, before the beginning of the next chapter. You may complete the quiz as many time as you like,
and each mastery level to which you progress will be used as extra credit for the calculation of your grade.
3.​ Article Summary: Read, discuss, and summarize an assigned research article. The article will be posted on
Blackboard. DUE as noted in assignment
4.​ Experiential Learning Assignment: Participate/attend a psychology and/or mental health related event
outside of the classroom, or a university event that you can relate to this course material.. I will make
frequent announcements of campus events that meet the criteria for this requirement. Acceptable events will
include: participating in a research study or psychology experiment, being a volunteer for psychological
testing, attending a lecture by a mental health professional, attending a Psychology Club, Psi Chi, or
Psychology Department event, attending a Wellness Center mental health event, or a Psychology/Mental
Health related presentation off campus. Off-campus events need the instructor’s approval in order to receive
credit for this requirement. You will write a brief report relating the activity to the course content. DUE: the
class after your participation
5.​ Data Collection Projects: Participate in the data collection for 2 small research projects completed outside of
class. You will write a brief report for each project and be prepared to discuss them in class. DUE: TBA
6.​ Research Participation: Participate in 5 research studies conducted by SU psychology students either in
person or online. DUE: upon completion.
7.​ Happiness Assignment: After reading articles relating to the topic of happiness, you will write a paper
detailing your responses to specific questions. DUE: As part of the final exam
8.​ Student Showcase: Attend the Psychology Student Showcase and write a summary of your experience.

Participation & Professionalism: The basic principle is that I expect respectful behavior in this class. Your
participation grade will be based on your professionalism, engagement, and contribution in large group and small
group discussions in class as well as large group, small group, and individual in-class activities. There will be no
opportunities to make up participation points. You must be present (both physically and mentally) in class in order to
receive participation points. We are all colleagues and collaborators in learning. Therefore, we should all treat each
other with the consideration and respect of professionals. Professionalism will count towards your grade. Therefore,
you will lose points for any non-professional activities.
These include all disruptive and disrespectful behaviors including:
texting during class;
using your laptop or tablet for ANYTHING other than taking notes during class;
tardiness or leaving class early;
missing appointments with class colleagues including faculty;
failing to work collaboratively and respectfully with peers;

Final Grade

​

Exams (100 points each)

300 points

COURSE POLICIES
Unscheduled University Closings
If there is an unscheduled university closing on the day that an assignment is due, the assignment
deadline will remain unchanged if it was to be submitted through Blackboard (assuming Blackboard is
operable). If a quiz is administered in class on the day of an unscheduled closing, the quiz will be
postponed until the next class meeting.
School Closings
In the event of a school closing, the SU Alert System will send text messages to smartphones indicating
the nature of the closing and further instructions, as necessary.

Communication
I prefer to talk to you in person about any ideas or issues you may have, so please schedule an
appointment to meet with me! If you miss class, please get notes from a classmate and then meet with
me to discuss anything you don’t understand from those notes. If you need to email me, allow 48 hours
for a response (although I’ll do my best to respond as soon as possible). I will often correspond with you
through campus e-mail or Blackboard announcements. Please become familiar with how to log on to
both systems and check your e-mail regularly. Class changes and updates will be posted in Blackboard
and sent to your Stevenson e-mail address.
Classroom Policies:
We are all colleagues and collaborators in learning. Therefore, we should all treat each other with the
consideration and respect of professionals. Since attendance is not required, if you can’t abide by these
guidelines, just work from home.

We are all adults here, act like it.
No texting or using cell phones during class;
No using your laptop or tablet for ANYTHING other than taking notes during class;
Be here on time and only leave early if you must.
You should work collaboratively and respectfully with peers;
Don’t talk during class except to contribute to the discussion. You may be asked to leave if
this behavior persists.

​
Submission of Assignments or Projects:
Standards for Grading Written Assignments
APA style is the recommended format. Please, remember to properly footnote/reference ideas that
are not your own. Give the full reference of the research article (author, year, title, journal name,
volume, pages) using APA style. Help with references can be found at the Perdue Online Writing Lab
(http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/) and at the American Psychological Association
website (http://www.apastyle.org/index.aspx).
Missed Assignment
Meeting deadline is an important skill. You will generally get a more positive appraisal if you meet the
deadlines, meaning there is generally a way to regain lost credits.. To miss or extended an assignment,
you should send me an e-mail letting me know, if possible 24 hours in advance. In all cases, the decision
to allow a student to make up a test or assignment, as well as the time period for any extension is left to
my discretion.
There are several situations that are accepted as no penalty:
1)​ hospitalization or illness whose symptomatology has been documented and judged by your professor
as preventing sufficient test preparation or your ability to sit for a test;
2) a death or serious illness in the family; or
3) court appearances

University Policy on Attendance
Each student is responsible for his or her own class attendance and regular attendance is expected. Every
student is responsible for the material covered or the skills exercised during scheduled classes. Grades will be
based on demonstrated achievement of the objectives of the course, not on attendance in class as such.
Students who stop attending and fail to officially withdraw from a class will be given a grade of "FX" which
calculates as an "F" in the GPA.
Course-Specific Attendance
This class works best when you are here. The Lab component in particular is accomplished in real time and
much of the activity can be completed in the assigned time. Missing the Lab will almost certainly delay your
progress. The TA’s are available to help you in that time, and can assist at other times at their discretion. I
generally know when you are here and when you are not.
I will monitor your attendance in accordance with mandates from the Stevenson University Registrar.
While you will not earn a grade for attendance, failure to attend class regularly may cause you to miss
assignments, pertinent information, and opportunities for participation. As a result, it is to your benefit
to attend class regularly. If you continually fail to attend class, I will contact you to discuss your
attendance.

Grading Standards:
The above Stevenson grading system will be used. Because you have all semester to earn points, I do NOT negotiate
grades at the end of the semester. Furthermore, I will NOT offer any extra credit assignment. I would be happy to talk
to you about ways to improve your grade throughout the semester!
Continuance and Progression Policies, if applicable: N/A

Course Requirements:
Exams (50% of your total grade) The purpose of these exams is to assess your understanding of and
ability to apply the material in this class. Some questions will focus on assessing your knowledge and
others will assess how well you can apply the information you have learned in class to realistic
situations. There will be four non-cumulative exams in this class. Each exam is worth 125 points and
will consist of a combination of multiple choice and short answer questions. The final exam (i.e., Exam
4) will be the same format and worth the same number of points as the three midterm exams. Note that
the final exam is not cumulative. Very selectively, permission may be given to miss an exam and take a
makeup exam due to extenuating circumstances. Evidence (e.g., doctor’s note or other verification) will
be required (but may not be sufficient) in order to get permission to make up an exam. Students who
are requesting a makeup exam must submit the request form to the instructor (available on Blackboard).
If you miss an exam and are not permitted a makeup exam, you will receive a 0 on that exam.
​
Reflection Papers (30% of your total grade) The reflection papers give you an opportunity to
connect your own experience of human development to the material you are learning in this class. You
will be submitting four reflection papers for this course. All reflections should be submitted through
Blackboard by the time and date specified in the assignment. Each paper is worth 75 points. Late
papers will lose 7.5 points for each 24-hour period. For example, if a paper is due at 11:59pm on
Wednesday and you do not submit it until 12:15pm on Friday, the maximum possible points you can
earn for that paper will be 75 – (7.5 x 2) = 60. Each reflection paper should be about 2-3 pages long,
double-spaced written with Times New Roman font. Specific prompts will be discussed in class and
then posted on the course website at least a week prior to the due date. Please cite your instructor (M.
Wong, personal communication, Insert date here) and/or the textbook for in-text citations. A reference
is not necessary for these papers. If you are unfamiliar with APA style, visit
http://www.apastyle.org/learn/tutorials/basics-tutorial.aspx and pay special attention to slides 13 to 25.
Be sure to visit Blackboard for more information.
​
Weekly In-Class Quizzes (10% of your total grade) In order to ensure that you are keeping up with
the readings, understanding the course material, and prepared to discuss topics in class, there will be
in-class quizzes related to the readings and other material covered in class (see class schedule). Makeup
quizzes will only be given for students with extenuating circumstances (e.g., illnesses with proper
documentation) and students will need to fill out a makeup request form available on Blackboard. Each
quiz is worth 10 points. These quizzes will include a mix of questions related to topics from the most
recent class meetings and assigned readings.
​
Participation & Professionalism (10% of your total grade) Your participation grade will be based on
your professionalism, engagement, and contribution in large group and small group discussions and
activities in class. There will be no opportunities to make up participation points. You must be present
(both physically and mentally) in class in order to receive participation points. You will be given some
early feedback regarding your participation and professionalism before the middle of the semester. We
are all colleagues and collaborators in learning. Therefore, we should all treat each other with the
consideration and respect of professionals. Therefore, you will lose points for any non-professional
activities. These include all disruptive and disrespectful behaviors including: using your computer
device (e.g., laptop, cell phone, tablet, etc.) without approval from instructor (also see Policies on p.4 of

326
the syllabus); tardiness or leaving class early; missing appointments with faculty (or peers); failing to
work collaboratively and respectfully with peers; participating in “extracurricular” conversations
during class.

COURSE POLICIES
Policies: Late policy: All late assignments will lose 10% of its worth for each 24-hour period. Please note: No
Computer Device Allowed in Class. No computer device (e.g., laptop, tablet, cell phone, etc.) will be allowed
in class except with permission from the instructor. A study published in Psychological Science (one of the
most prestigious journals in the field of Psychology) by Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) found that using
computers to take notes would actually hinder learning. In contrast, taking notes via longhand (i.e., traditional
pen and paper) would encourage deeper processing, thus better understanding of the materials. Not to
mention, students who use computer device during class tend to go off-task very frequently, which is really
disrespectful to the instructor, and distracting for everyone else in class. Students who are requesting to use a
computer device in class must complete a request form available on Blackboard.
Classroom Policies: I prefer to talk to you in person about any ideas or issues you may have, so please visit
my office hours or schedule an appointment to meet with me! If you miss class, please get notes from a
classmate and then meet with me to discuss anything you don’t understand from those notes. I will often
correspond with you through campus email or Blackboard announcements. Please become familiar with how
to log on to both systems and check your email regularly. Class changes and updates will be posted in
Blackboard and sent to your Stevenson email address.
Submission of Assignments or Projects: Exams and Quizzes are in class, unless communicated otherwise.
Reflection papers are due to Blackboard.
Attendance
Each student is responsible for his or her own class attendance and regular attendance is expected. Every
student is responsible for the material covered or the skills exercised during scheduled classes. Grades will
be based on demonstrated achievement of the objectives of the course, not on attendance in class as such.
Students who stop attending and fail to officially withdraw from a class will be given a grade of "FX" which
calculates as an "F" in the GPA.
Course-Specific Attendance
I expect you to come to class. Missing class regularly may cause you to miss quizzes, in-class activities, and pertinent
information. If you continually fail to attend class, I will contact you to discuss your attendance.

Prerequisite(s): A grade of C or better in ENG 150, ENG 151 or ENG 153 (may be taken concurrently).
Classroom or Studio Location: DC 306
Scheduled Class Days and Time: Mondays & Wednesdays 11:00-12:15 pm
Course Description:

Introduces building blocks of knowledge in the discipline of sociology, a discipline that examines how humans
interact and how their interactions are influenced by social forces. The course covers core concepts and theoretical
perspectives in sociology, how sociological research is done, and offers the student critical insight into the social
processes and institutions that affect people’s lives. ​ ​
This is a SEE-certified Social Sciences 3cr course.
Instructional Methods Used in this Course:

How would you best succeed in this course? You can best succeed by engaging in active and intentional
reading/learning of the assigned materials and coming to class ready to actively participate in the class discussions by
making comments, asking and answering questions. This means you will read the materials for each class in
advance. To make everyone’s involvement possible, the class will be split into small groups to generate
questions/comments on the week’s topic for class discussion. In this way, all class members will have an opportunity
to actively participate, talk, so we can all break the monotony of hearing just my voice. Please note that if the class
gets too quiet, I might call on class members to share their thoughts and I hope those so asked won’t consider it as
“picking” on them.

Continuance and Progression Policies, if applicable (refers to any policy that dictates that a student must
achieve a particular grade in the course to move on to the next course or to continue in the major, etc. For

335
example, you must receive a C or better in this course in order to enroll in X course.) Please discuss program
requirements and standards with the Program Coordinator, Department Chair, or Associate Dean.
Course Requirements:
Tests/Exams

We will have four tests/exams. Each test will combine multiple-choice and essay questions. The questions in these
tests/exams will be drawn from our class discussions and assigned readings. Three of these tests will be done on
Blackboard. These tests will be opened on the Friday of the scheduled week, remaining open until Sunday midnight.
Students are responsible for ensuring that they take these tests as scheduled, using reliable internet connection. The
fourth is the final exam which will be in-class. A make-up for a missed test will be arranged only if the reasons for
missing the test are officially tenable, and appropriate documentation is provided. These tests make up 50% of the
course points.
Socio-autobiography Paper​ ​
(Due: April 12)
We understand something the most when we either experience it or are able to relate to it, one way or another. This
assignment requires students to explore how sociology relates to them, using their life experiences. It is an
opportunity for them to demonstrate their understanding of key sociological vocabulary words (sociological
concepts). So each student will write a 3-4 page paper, a socio-autobiography, typed in normal font, 2-line spaced,
narrating a life experience within any of the themes listed below. This must be a coherent story of your experience,
within any one of the themes listed below. These concepts must flow naturally with the story and not be forced into
the narrative to make the tally. The key things I’m looking for in this paper are:
i)​
the use, appropriately, of 15 sociology concepts, typed in bold font throughout the paper: you do not
need to define these concepts in your paper. Note that the task here is to use sociology concepts NOT
theory. Do NOT use any theory in this paper. Each concept should be typed in bold only once even
if you use it several times in your paper.
ii)​
an appropriate topic for the paper, within any of the listed themes, to use these concepts. Note that
“socio-autobiography” is the title of this assignment. It cannot be used as title for your paper.
iii)​
evidence of ability to use/apply the sociological imagination to your story.
Some possible themes include the following:
​ a)​
work (your status and role(s) as an employee)
​ b)​
school (the transition to high school or college)
​ c)​
changing one’s identity or claiming a new identity
d)​
the process of becoming a member of a group or learning to do something new
​ e)​
creating and sustaining intimate/romantic relationships
Many other themes may be developed. Please consult me if you have a suggestion for a theme that does
not appear in this list.
This paper will be graded based on the appropriate use of the selected sociology concepts, appropriate title
for the paper, organization of the essay, clarity of thought, coherence of the story, use of proper grammar,
and use of the sociological imagination. Make sure to proofread your paper before submission. Spelling
and grammatical mistakes will be penalized with point deduction. See the rubric attached.
Students are required to include (write) the pledge at the top (beginning) of this paper.
This paper is worth 20% of the course points.

336

Identifying Sociology Concepts in a Text​ (due: April 26)
In this assignment, students will read an assigned material and identify the sociology concepts (not
theories) in the text they read. These concepts may be used explicitly by the author(s), they may be
described but not explicitly named or they may be detected as underlying ideas of the text, not necessarily
mentioned explicitly or even described. The material for this assignment is “The polygamous town facing
genetic disaster” – on Blackboard. In your paper, the concepts shall be numbered numerically, you will
reproduce the text carrying the concept (the entire sentence, not parts of it) and provide the number of
the page where it can be found. Highlight the concept (in yellow), if it appears in the text or highlight the
portion of the sentence that describes or carries the idea of the concept, or the entire sentence if that is the
case. Do not list a concept more than once. Derivatives of a concept will not be counted e.g. if you list
polygyny, polygynous will not be counted as another concept. See the Blackboard for the example of how
this paper shall be formatted.
There are more than 15 sociology concepts in this text, used either explicitly, described but not directly
mentioned or as underlying ideas of the text. In this assignment, you will identify 15 of these concepts.
Note: the only texts in this paper are those from the article. You are not allowed to write anything of your
own in this paper.
This paper is worth 15% of the course points.
Group Project/Presentation
Working in small groups of 5-6, students will pick a topic from the following, research it and present in
class: Right to Marry; Immigration Reform; Mass Shootings; Healthcare for all Americans (Obamacare);
Voter ID Laws; Death Penalty; and “Black Lives Matter”. Group members are expected to exercise
discretion on the specific direction they wish to take their topic. They should aim at sharing significant
new information on their topic with their colleagues.
Groups will research their chosen topics and present their findings in class. All members of the group
must participate in the research, compilation or organization of materials, and presentation of their
findings. Group members who fail to participate in any aspect of this project: research, compilation, and
presentation, shall not be entitled to the points for this assignment. Groups may select a topic outside of
this list but such topic shall be cleared with me. No written report is required.
Groups may use available teaching aids eg PowerPoint – video clips shall not be longer than 3 minutes
and will have to be approved by me.
Groups are required to display the pledge in PowerPoint before commencing their presentations.
The group presentation is 5% of the course points.
Discussion Questions
The class will be split into small groups. Each group will be assigned one or more class topics. The
group reads the assigned materials for the topic, and other relevant sources, and comes to class, on the
date of the topic, with 5 questions or comments on their assigned topic, for the class to discuss. These
should not be one-liners so must be framed in a way that generates discussion among class members, not
yes or no responses. These questions must be generated by the group members, not copied from their
sources. Group members should review their questions and make all necessary corrections before

submission. Spelling and grammatical mistakes will be penalized. The discussion questions are worth
5% of the course points.

Video Review​
-​ due May 3 (Optional: only as Extra-Credit)
Students who so desire may write a 2-3 page review of the documentary Generation M: Misogyny in
Media and Culture. Your opening paragraph summarily captures the video’s theme, explains it and states
the subthemes under which it is discussed in the video. Dedicate each subsequent paragraph to each of
the subthemes: identify the subtheme and summarize how the video explains or discusses it ensuring that
the key points of a subtheme are sufficiently reflected in your summary. In your final/concluding
paragraph, comment critically on the documentary with reference specifically to the video’s theme,
highlighting any insights this video affords you on the general topic of gender inequality. Make sure to
correct all spelling and grammatical mistakes in your paper before submission. Spelling and grammatical
mistakes will be penalized with point deduction.
Students who do this assignment are required to include (write) the pledge at the top (beginning) of this
paper.
Group Discussion (GD) ​
-​
due May 3 (Optional: only as Extra-Credit)
The class will break up into small groups of 5-6 to discuss the article “Lesbians blurring the
boundaries….” The discussion will be conducted using a discussion guide I will provide. No written
report is required. However, students may submit a 2-3 page report answering the questions in the
discussion guide, on the due date, for extra-credit points. Make sure to number your answers
correspondingly. To use this assignment for extra-credit, students must participate in the in-class group
discussion. This paper must be written individually.
Students who do this assignment are required to include (write) the pledge at the top (beginning) of this
paper.
Extra-Credit Assignment
Two extra-credit assignments are provided in this syllabus: the video review and the group discussion
papers. Students who are interested may do any one of them. In addition, students may attend a HaSS
event and report on it for extra-credit. I will announce the HaSS events in class (and on Blackboard) and
provide details of topic, venue and time. This will be a 2-3 page, double-line spaced, report explaining
the topic of the event, relates it to concepts covered in class or in the textbook, and highlights what new
things you learnt from the event. Each extra-credit assignment is worth 4% points. All extra-credit
papers are due on May 3.

COURSE POLICIES
Policies:

The deadlines for all assignments must be observed. Late submissions will not be accepted except when due to
circumstances that are officially tenable and backed by relevant documentation, or the student has my prior consent to
be late.
Classroom and Studio Policies:

338
Students are allowed to use laptops in this class, strictly for notetaking. Cellphones may be brought to this class but
they must be on mute.

Submission of Assignments or Projects:

All tests, with the exception of the final exam, and written assignments shall be done on or submitted
through the Blackboard. Written assignments submitted through the Blackboard must be in Word doc,
typed in 2-line spacing, in Times New Roman font size 12, stay within the page limit as specified. Do not
email assignments to me or submit assignments in class. The deadlines for all assignments shall be
observed. Late submissions will not be accepted except when due to circumstances that are officially
tenable and backed by relevant documentation, or the student has my prior consent to be late. The
preferred referencing style for all written assignments is the APA style. Make sure to read the
instructions/guidelines for every assignment before you do it. Failure to follow instructions for an
assignment might lead to rejection of the paper or points deduction. All assignments submitted through
the Blackboard are screened through SafeAssign. Students are required to include (write) the pledge at the
top of every written assignment. The final exam shall be in-class.
Attendance
Each student is responsible for his or her own class attendance and regular attendance is expected. Every student is
responsible for the material covered or the skills exercised during scheduled classes. Grades will be based on
demonstrated achievement of the objectives of the course, not on attendance in class as such. Students who stop
attending and fail to officially withdraw from a class will be given a grade of "FX" which calculates as an "F" in the
GPA.
Course-Specific Attendance
Regular and punctual attendance of classes is required because class discussions typically draw on materials and sources
outside of the assigned readings. Class discussions offer an invaluable opportunity for students to be active participants
in the learning process. In fact, course-points are allotted to class participation and you cannot earn these points if you
don’t attend classes. Overall, you cannot pass this class if you do not attend classes.
