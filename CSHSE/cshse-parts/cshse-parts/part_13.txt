Family Dynamics and Interventions (CHS 430-02 & 03)
FALL 2018

Assignment 1 - Family of Origin Project
General instructions: This assignment requires you to apply the concept and theories we will
study to your family of origin. In order to complete this assignment you will need to conduct at
least two interviews of family members. You may interview parents, grandparents, siblings,
aunts, uncles, or cousins. You will cite these interviews in your bibliography. Please discuss
confidentiality with your interviewees, get permission to use the interview material, and use only
initials when identifying participants. You may include pieces of transcript in your paper only
with expressed permission of your interviewee.
Instructions for paper:
Section one: (1 page) Produce a detailed genogram of your family of origin covering at least
three (3) generations (going back to your grandparents). The genogram may be hand drawn or
you can use a genogram software program. A number of programs are available to download for
free. (One good program is available at www.genopro.com but many other are also available,
enter “free genogram software” on Google for an extensive list.) You may use an extra large
sheet of paper if you wish.
Section two: (4 to 10 pages) In narrative form, write a complete systemic analysis of your
family of origin, referring back to the genogram. Issues you should cover and include:
1.​ _____ Boundaries (within the family as well as between the family and the world);
2.​
_____ Hierarchies, subsystems, & alliances within the family (also discuss
triangulation, power & cutoffs);
3.​
_____ Roles Played by Family Members (Scapegoat, Hero, Comic, Lost Child,
Enabler, Violent or Angry One)
4.​ _____ Sibling Cohesion;
5.​ _____ Rules (spoken and unspoken);
6.​ _____ Significant Losses & Family Adaptation;
7.​ _____ Family Life Cycle;
8.​ _____ Family Myths, Secrets, & Lies;
9.​ _____ Role & Effect of Birth Order;
10.​_____ Transgenerational Patterns & Issues
You must give specific behavioral examples to back up your analysis. Don’t just say, for
example, that there were strong intergenerational boundaries. Discuss the specific
behaviors that demonstrated that those boundaries existed.
Section three: (4 to 8 pages) Select a theme of your choice to research and apply to your family
of origin. You may create your own theme or select from the following list:

1. The effects of alcoholism or addiction on the family.
2. Blended and step family issues.

CHS 430 Assignment 2 - Group Project
You will be assigned to “families”. These families will be the subjects of the role plays we will do in
class. In addition, your “family” will be your workgroup for the completion of this assignment. Your
“family” will be assigned an “issue” or issues that bring you to therapy and will also be assigned a theory
from which to approach this issue.
Class time will be allotted to help you prepare, but you will need to do considerable work and
communication outside of class in order to complete this assignment.
Part one: Meet as a group.
1. Assign roles, deciding who will be the parents, the children, etc. Decide on the age and gender of the
children. 2. Who is/are the identified patient(s)?
3. Describe the relationships between family members.
4. Develop an identity and history for each family member.
5. Decide how the identified problem will play out in the family.
Keep notes of your decisions.
Part two: In addition to a family “issue” you will be assigned a particular theory. You will need to
research how your assigned issue would be addressed within this theory. For example if your issue was
“alcoholism within the family” and your assigned theory was “solution-focused” you would need to
research how a solution-focused family therapist would address alcoholism in the family. Your group will
then do a demonstration of this
approach to this problem by role-playing a family session for the class. This presentation should be no
more than 30 minutes. For purposes of this demonstration, one of your group members will need to step
out of his or her usual family role in order to be “the therapist”.
Part three: As part of the presentation your group will do a brief (30 minute maximum) didactic
presentation on how your theory would address the techniques that were demonstrated and the theoretical
constructs involved. Be prepared to answer questions. You will want to provide the class with a coherent,
well organized summary of your assigned theory highlighting terms, concepts, and key points associated
with the theory. Dates for these presentations will coincide with the schedule of readings on each theory.
Grading:
Part one (Family Description) 25 points
Part two (Family Therapy Demonstration) 25 points
Part three (Presentation on Your Assigned Theory) 25 points
Part four (Individual Participation) as graded by fellow group members & instructor. 25 points
Total possible: 100 points
Major Family Therapy Approaches​
Object Relations. (Framo and Scharff).​
Experiential. (Satir and Whitaker).​
Transgenerational. (Bowen).​
Structural. (Minuchin).​
Strategic. (Haley).​
Cognitive-Behavioral. (Beck and Ellis).​
Social Constructionist. (deShazer and Anderson).​
Narrative. (Michael White).​
​

1. Object Relations. (Framo and Scharff).Satisfying relationship with some “object” (e.g., parent) is a
fundamental need. Helps client gain insight into early relationships (objects from past) and how they
affect current relationships enabling individual development and fulfilling relationships.​
​
2. Experiential. (Satir and Whitaker).Troubled families need a “growth experience” derived from an
intimate interpersonal experience (therapy). By being real (authentic) and self-disclosing, families learn to
be more honest, more expressive, and better able to achieve personal and interpersonal growth. For Satir,
building self-esteem and learning to communicate openly are essential goals. Whitaker suggested that
helping family members probe their own world of symbolic meanings frees them to activate innate
growth processes.
​
3. Transgenerational. (Bowen).Thinking, feeling, and behaving are tied to the family system. The
individual’s problems arise and are maintained by relationship connections. Problems are passed from one
generation to the next. Fusion = most vulnerable; Differentiation of self = least vulnerable.​
​
4. Structural. (Minuchin). Focuses on how families are organized and what rules govern their
transactions. Pays attention to rules, roles, alignments, coalitions, and boundaries. Challenges rigid,
repetitive transactions within a family, helping to “unfreeze” them and allow family reorganization.​
​
5. Strategic. (Haley).Assigns tasks to get family to change aspects of the system that maintain problematic
behavior. Paradoxical interventions are employed to force clients to abandon symptoms. NOT interested
in providing insight.​
​
6. Cognitive-Behavioral. (Beck and Ellis).Maladaptive behaviors can be extinguished as the contingencies
of reinforcement are altered. Focuses on communication skills, parent training skills, cognitive
restructuring, etc.​
​
7. Social Constructionist. (deShazer and Anderson).Suggests that each of our perceptions is not an exact
duplication of the world, rather, a point of view seen through the limiting lens of our assumptions about
people. Therapy involves jointly constructing new options that change past accounts and allow new
alternatives.​
​
8. Narrative. (Michael White).Our sense of reality is organized and maintained through stories.​
Families present with negative, dead-end stories. The goal is to explore alternative stories, make new
assumptions, and open up new possibilities by re-authoring stories.​

CHS 441 Seminar in Human Services
Issue Paper and Presentation
For your issue presentation, choose an issue or challenge that you have been facing at your site this
semester. It doesn't necessarily have to be a problem, but something that you have noticed or had to
deal with. You can get some ideas from your textbook, particularly the sections in chapter 8 about
"Encountering Challenges" starting on p. 224 and "Issues with the Site" on p. 237. You will be expected
to write a 3-4 page paper that describes the issue and possible resolutions. Do some research about the
issue and include information from this additional reading in your paper (be sure to use appropriate APA
format to cite your sources). In class, you will give a 10-15 minute presentation to the group about the
issue. It does not need to be a formal presentation with PowerPoint slides, just be prepared to describe
the issue and how you have handled it to the class.

CHS 441 – Practicum Seminar
Professional Portfolio Assignment
In this class, you will complete the professional portfolio that you have been developing. The
portfolio will document your knowledge and skills and help you reflect about what you have
done and what you will do. Your portfolio will help you to prepare for job interviews and
graduate school applications.
Your professional portfolio will be unique, but it will contain the four common elements listed
below and the components related to each of them. You should include an introduction section
with a complete and professional resume; a list of courses with brief descriptions, reflection on
your learning, and examples of your work; a field experiences section that summarizes you
work in the human services field (this is different from your resume); and a section on your
professional philosophy and values and your professional goals. It is imperative that you
proofread carefully for spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
I. Introduction
A. Title Page
B.​ Table of Contents
C.​ Resume
II. Academic Work
A.​ List of courses taken that are relevant to your Professional Objective with brief
description of each (The University catalog is a good reference; if used, you should cite
it.)
B.​ Reflection on how your academic learning has affected you as a human service
Professional.
C.​ Examples of academic work that illustrate your competency.
III. Field Experiences [Course related (internship or practicum), volunteer, job]
For each field experience, you should include the following:
A.​ Summary that includes name of placement, dates in placement, description of population
(age, socio-economic mix, culture, special needs, etc.), and description of
responsibilities.
B.​ Discussion of what you have learned
C.​ Supervisor's evaluation if you have participated in an internship or practicum (not
required, but highly recommended)

(Sweitzer and King, 2009, p. 212).
​
Your attitudes, values, behaviors, unresolved issues, psychosocial and cultural
identities all contribute to your view your experience. Some of the qualities
you have discovered in yourself you may consider to be ​
positive;
others may cause you difficulty.
