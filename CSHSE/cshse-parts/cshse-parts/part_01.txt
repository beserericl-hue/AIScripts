Copies of the Faculty Performance Appraisal- Department Chair Evaluation, Student
Evaluation Form, Faculty Response to Student Evaluation Data, Classroom Observation Form,
and Midterm Faculty Evaluation Form can be found in the Appendix.
In addition to the aforementioned vehicles of evaluation, students in field placements evaluate
their University Supervisor using the University Supervisor Evaluation Form.
d.

Document how the evaluative process is used to identify strengths and limitations and how it is
incorporated in specific procedures for improvement.
Table of Contents
Response:
Using the Faculty Performance Appraisal Form, faculty members rate themselves and are rated
by the Department Chair as exceeding, meeting, or falling below a number of performance
areas, thereby helping to identify strengths and limitations. Specific techniques for improving
areas of limitation are discussed in individual meetings with the Department Chair and
documented as recommendations which are reviewed annually.
For each course taught by a faculty member, final student evaluations serve as another method
for identifying strengths and limitations in such areas as methods, style and practice of
instruction, and course content. Faculty members are required to respond to the student
evaluation data by identifying strengths, concerns, and intended corrective actions. This process
encourages reflection on, and incorporation of, specific procedures for improvement. See
Faculty Response to Student Evaluation Data Form.
In addition, students evaluate faculty members at midterm. This information is valuable to
faculty members in adjusting instruction to meet the needs of students in each of their classes.
Midterm evaluations are reviewed solely by each faculty member.

e.

​

Describe how faculty and staff are provided opportunities for relevant professional
development.
Table of Contents
Response:
A number of opportunities exist to promote faculty professional development, including
programs through Human Resources and initiatives within Academic Affairs. Faculty research
is supported through the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research which provides funding
for attending and presenting at conferences, grant writing and publishing workshops, hosts a
summer writers retreat (which has been attended by faculty in the department), a winter writing
workshop, and provides research and scholarship grants. A faculty development initiative with
Academic Affairs hosts electronic training workshops (Blackboard, Hoonuit, Office 365, etc.),
provides diversity and inclusion resources, and compiles information on teaching strategies and
supporting students. A regular interdisciplinary speakers series within the School of Humanities
and Social Sciences provides faculty with opportunities to discuss cogent issues across
disciplines. The Human Resources office regularly holds professional development workshops
on a variety of topics, including a faculty interactive workshop series, sessions on creativity,
conflict, leadership, and supporting students.
Funding for faculty conference attendance. Full-time faculty members are eligible to receive
funding to either attend or participate in professional conferences and also to conduct

research. Part-time faculty members are eligible to receive funding only if they are
presenting at a professional conference. Funds may be requested for conferences,
conventions, or workshops. There is no geographic limit on the requests that may be
considered.

H. Cultural Competence
Context: To ensure the program is effective in producing culturally competent professionals who
possess high level of self-awareness, knowledge, and skills in the complexities of
multiculturalism. This encompasses the individual, family, and group levels as well as
agency/organizational, community, and globally.
Standard 8: The program shall foster the development of culturally competent professionals
through program characteristics, curriculum, and fieldwork.
Specifications for Standard 8:
a.

Demonstrate how the program
1.​ Includes cultural competence in program policies, procedures, and practices.
Table of Contents
Response: Cultural competence is deeply embedded in the Counseling & Human Services
program and throughout Stevenson University. One of the campus leaders in cultural
competence issues, Lauri Weiner, is a full-time faculty member in the department. She teaches
the required course CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence, serves on a college-wide
diversity task force, and has facilitated or co-led an ongoing series of faculty/student
conversations on diversity for the past several years. Cultural competence is #4 of the six
program outcomes. Professional expectations are emphasized throughout the program, but are
included as prerequisites for participation in field experiences. These expectations explicitly
include culturally sensitive behavior (item #1), as described in the student handbook. As
indicated below, cultural competence skills are emphasized in multiple ways throughout the
program and students are provided opportunities to develop and practice these skills. If a student
continues to violate these expectations after repeated attempts to remediate the issue, this can be
a basis for removal from the program (see Standard 5c and d).
2.​ Includes cultural competence training for faculty and staff
Response: Institutionally, Stevenson University is committed to promoting cultural awareness
and sensitivity in students, faculty and staff. A college-wide taskforce is working on developing
systematic requirements for faculty to engage in cultural competence training. Currently,
participation in training opportunities is voluntary. Through Academic Affairs Faculty
Development, Diversity and Inclusion resources are available to faculty, including programs on
Inclusivity in the Classroom, Language Variation in the Classroom, Confronting the Lies I Tell
Myself, and a Peer Mentoring program for faculty. Human Resources offers periodic trainings
related to diversity and cultural competence for the college community. Within the Counseling
& Human Services Department, monthly faculty meetings regularly include discussions of
student issues, which frequently relate to diversity and cultural competence issues. These
regular discussions help to keep faculty attuned to these issues and give us an opportunity to
have important conversations within the department. Prof. Weiner co-facilitates the

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

Page 33 of 511

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

“Conversations on Diversity” series, which involves 2-3 meetings each semester. These sessions
typically include students, and are also an opportunity for faculty within the School of
Humanities and Social Sciences to engage in conversations on a selected aspect of diversity.
Most faculty in the Counseling & Human Services department have participated in these
discussions regularly.
b.

Demonstrate how the curriculum integrates cultural competence:
1.​ Includes but is not limited to student self-awareness of own culture, biases, prejudice, and
belief systems and stereotyping.
Table of Contents
Response: The curriculum includes CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural Competence as a required
course. As part of this course, students complete a cultural autobiography and write three
response papers that require reflection on their own cultural beliefs and experiences and how
they affect their perception of the world. This emphasis on cultural self-reflection is introduced
in the First Year Seminar (a 1-credit course required of entering freshmen) and carried
throughout the curriculum. For example, in the capstone clinical skills course CHS 430 Family
Dynamics and Interventions, students complete a detailed family of origin assignment that
requires them to think deeply about their own family/cultural experiences and how those
experiences have affected their perceptions and attitudes. Self-awareness is a key part of the
program outcomes (see #6).
2.​ Includes the development of awareness, knowledge, and skills of diversity and culture.
Response: Awareness and knowledge of diversity and culture are integrated throughout the
curriculum, as described above. Another good example of the incorporation of cultural issues is
in CHS 101 Family Studies, which is focused on the diversity of family structures and includes
an assignment asking students to research and report on multiple facets of a controversial issue.
Skills are developed through the application of knowledge in the field experience courses, CHS
380 Internship and CHS 440 Practicum. In these courses, students work closely with on-site
supervisors and with faculty to practice and improve their skills. As indicated in the field
placement evaluation, which is completed as a self-evaluation by students and as a formal
evaluation by supervisors both in the middle and end of both experiences, both self-reflection
and culturally appropriate behaviors are strongly emphasized (see particularly sections IV and
II). Students also practice culturally appropriate strategies through role-playing exercises in both
the group and individual counseling courses (CHS 315 and CHS 360).

I. Program Support
Context: To address student needs, human service programs require adequate faculty, staff, and
program resources.
Standard 9: The program shall have adequate faculty, staff, and program resources.
Specifications for Standard 9:

a.

Include budgetary information that demonstrates sufficient funding, faculty, and staff to provide
an ongoing and stable program.
Table of Contents
NOTE: provide the reader both with a program budget and with a description of how to read
and interpret it.
Response:
The budget is developed and proposed annually by the Department Chair and submitted to the
Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences. See the operating budgets for 2018-2019
and for the upcoming year (2019-2020).
The total department budget of $8,683.89 has been decreasing for the past few years as part of
across-the-board spending reductions. Discretionary spending is allocated among 10 different
categories, including professional development, student travel, department events, and gifts to
others. Funds can be moved across categories, or into new categories to cover expenses that don’t
fit in an existing category. To read the budget, the first column for each line item indicated the
amount ‘Budgeted.” The column labeled “Actual” indicates expenses charged to line. The last
column is “Funds Available,” which indicates the amount remaining in the line or the amount
over the budgeted amount. The FY19 budget shows expenses in two categories (office supplies
and printing) that did not have funds allocated to them. At the end of the year, negative balances
are reconciled with lines that have a positive balance. For the past several years the department
has been able to operate within the overall budget while providing outstanding experiences for
students and supporting faculty and community partners (field placement sites).
Specific expenses in each of the categories where significant expenditures occurred in this fiscal
year are noted below:
Salaries PT Student: This line is for hiring a student assistant for the department. We had an
assistant for part of the semester, but she was not able to continue due to her scheduling issues,
which is why the expenditures are small. Unspent funds from this line cannot be moved to other
lines.
Student Supplies: This line is books and supplies needed for classrooms.
Promotional Give-Aways: Includes printing of departmental brochures and engraved pens.
Professional Development: Registration at the annual NOHS conference for faculty.
Professional Development Travel: Hotel at travel expenses for faculty at NOHS conference.
Students Conference: Student recipients of the Professional Development Award are taken to
NOHS conference each year. This line covers travel and registration expenses for the students.
Membership: Professional: CSHSE departmental membership and NOHS memberships for
faculty.
Dept/Div Events: Food: Advisory board breakfasts; honors induction ceremony; graduate
luncheons; senior poster session refreshments.
Gifts to Others: Field placement supervisors/agencies are given gifts (engraved portable chargers
or pen/keychain sets) at the end of each semester as a token of appreciation for working with our
students. This also includes engraved business card holders for graduates.

b.

​

Describe how program and field experience coordination is considered in calculating the teaching
loads of faculty. It is recommended that consideration be given to distance between sites,

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

​

Page 35 of 511

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

expectations of observation, documentation requirements, number of students enrolled in the
field experience, and the characteristics of the student population.
Table of Contents
Response:
Full-time faculty members maintain a twelve credit teaching load per semester. The Department
Chair is released from teaching two courses during the Fall semester and two courses during the
Spring semester in order to fulfill the responsibilities of the Department Chair as described in
Standard 7.
University faculty members responsible for field placements include the University Supervisors
and the Field Placement Coordinator. University Supervisors are adjunct faculty who provide
supervision for students in their practicums. These supervisors receive payment based upon the
number of students supervised (3-4 students = 1 credit hour), which we (and the supervisors)
believe is a reasonable load given the expected observation and documentation requirements.
Distance is a consideration when assigning University Supervisors to students placed at particular
sites. See Responsibilities of University Supervisor for Field Placements.
The Field Placement Coordinator is a full time faculty member, Dr. Finkenberg who receives a
one course equivalency to develop relationships with and visit new agencies, liaise with directors
of agencies used previously, conduct classroom and individual meetings with all prospective
interns and practicum students, determine and approve eligibility of students for field placements,
and ensure appropriate placement assignments for all interns and practicum students. During both
Fall and Spring semesters, the Field Placement Coordinator teaches CHS 440 Practicum as part
of the teaching load. So teaching responsibilities for the Field Placement Coordinator are:
Fall Semester
Spring Semester
CHS 440 Practicum
CHS 440 Practicum
2 academic courses
CHS 380 Internship (usually two sections)
1 academic course
See Responsibilities of Field Placement Coordinator.
c.

Describe how the program has adequate professional support staff to meet the needs of students,
faculty, and administration.
Table of Contents
Response:
Secretarial support for faculty members and for the program is provided by the University
receptionists as well as the School of Humanities and Social Sciences’ Administrative Assistant,
who has been particularly helpful with producing departmental materials, such as handbooks,
certificates, and invitations. The departmental brochure is produced by staff in the Marketing and
Digital Communications Department. Their assistance is greatly appreciated.

d.

Describe how there is adequate resource support (e.g., technology, library, computer labs, etc.) to
meet the needs of students, faculty, and administration.
Table of Contents
Response:
Technological/Computer Resources
Considerable resource support for the program is available through the library, technology,
computer labs, classroom technology, and tech support.

credits and the evaluation of prior learning.
Specifications for Standard 10:
a.

Describe formal policies and procedures, and informal practices for the transfer of credits and
evaluation of prior learning.
Table of Contents
Response:
Transfer credits from other regionally accredited colleges are accepted through the SU registrar’s
office. Course equivalencies for Maryland colleges are determined through the ArtSys database
and in consultation with the department chair. A grade of C or better is required for a course to
transfer. The department chair makes determinations about what program requirements are
fulfilled by transfer courses and substitutions may be made as appropriate. See formal
articulation agreements below.
One course in the Program, CHS 380 (Internship in Counseling & Human Services), may be
waived if the student provides evidence of the successful completion of a minimum of two years
full-time employment in a human services agency. The student must submit the following
documentation for approval: (1) Professional Portfolio and (2) Letter of Recommendation from
the supervisor at the agency. The documentation will be evaluated by the Department Chair and
the Field Placement Coordinator. No other required human services courses in the Program may
be waived.
The University participates in College Level Examination Program (CLEP), which allows
students to take a CLEP exam to earn credits at Stevenson. The University grants credit to SU
students earning Stevenson University designated passing scores on CLEP exams. For further
information regarding acceptable exams, please review the Stevenson University CLEP Manual
available on the Transfer Credit Center page of the website under Credit by Examination.

The University recognizes the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme and will grant
credit for scores of 5 or higher in the "Higher Level" courses only. Scores of 4 will be taken into
consideration, but not automatically granted credit. No credit is given for courses taken at the
subsidiary level or for courses that duplicate others taken for Advanced Placement credit.
Informal collaboration efforts occur through faculty members’ networking during national
(NOHS) and regional (MACHS) conferences. The Department Chair is a member of the
advisory boards for two Associate Degree human services programs (Community College of
Baltimore County and Anne Arundel Community College), and the Program Coordinator for an
Associate Degree Program (CCBC) is on the SU Counseling & Human Services Advisory Board.
Board meetings provide opportunities for both formal and informal collaborative efforts. The
Department Chair began an Associate Degree program in Human Services at Prince George’s
Community College before coming to Stevenson and remains in close consultation with the
Program Coordinator.
The Counseling & Human Services Program at Stevenson University has developed formal
articulation agreements with the following programs:
Community College Programs
●​ Anne Arundel Community College
●​ Community College of Baltimore County
●​ Frederick Community College
●​ Howard Community College (in progress)
Graduate School Program
●​ McDaniel College – Human Services Management Program: Special Education
●​ Stevenson University – Healthcare Management
●​ Stevenson University - Community Based Education and Leadership
We have entered into Articulation Agreements with each of the above listed community colleges
because they allow students from each of the institutions to continue a path in the study of human
services which builds upon substantial courses already completed in the field. See each
articulation agreement in the appendix for course equivalencies.
The articulation agreement with McDaniel College allows Stevenson Counseling & Human
Services majors who complete CHS 515 and CHS 540 to be eligible to obtain a Master’s Degree
in Human Services Management: Special Education in one year.
Students interested in the Stevenson Healthcare Management or Community Based Education
and Leadership M.S. programs can apply to the BS to MS Option accelerated program and finish
the combined program in five years. The two graduate level courses (CHS 515 and CHS 540)
count towards the major and students can start taking graduate courses in the program during
their final year in the undergraduate program and pay the standard undergraduate tuition.
Students from Stevenson who want to transfer credits to graduate programs have the opportunity
to take two courses at the graduate level (CHS 515 and CHS 540). As explained in the response
