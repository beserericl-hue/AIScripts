PROGRAM EVALUATION PLAN
A. Measures and Timing
Evaluation is a critical part of the Counseling & Human Services Department. The needs of our
communities, both our external community (agencies) and our internal community (students), are
evaluated extensively and frequently through both quantitative and qualitative measures.
1. QUANTITATIVE MEASURES. Quantitative measures and the timing for each are as follows:
​

a. Agency Evaluation by Student – At end of field placement

​
​

Evaluation Results
2018-2019
Commentary on Evaluation Results
The results of the 2018-2019 Counseling & Human Services Program Evaluation confirm
that the present curriculum and field experiences are effective in meeting the program
mission, “to provide students with an educational foundation that will prepare them for
meaningful and effective careers within the human services field and successful continuation
of their education.” Student field placement evaluations also indicate that the program goals
are being met.
Twenty four students graduated in the 2018-2019 academic year. This is slightly lower
than the previous year, but represents a stabilization in the decline of graduates, which is
similar to the pattern for the number of majors. (see report below). The official number of
majors for the Fall of 2019 will be reported on the census date of October 15. A new
cohort of certificate students at Sheppard Pratt will be starting this fall, but the exact
number is not know at this time.

On the Program Evaluation Form and in the Senior Focus Groups, students praised their
CHS courses and the Human Services faculty. Some suggestions related to the curriculum
included an expansion of topics course offerings and tracks to include such areas as: child
life, disabilities and special education, counseling for children and youth, and school
counseling.
Several students questioned the usefulness of some of the general education courses and the
administration and counseling courses for those not interested in pursuing those areas. The
change in department name was generally positively received.

Part 2 – Summary of Responses to Short-Answer Items
1.​ What did you feel was the most worthwhile part of this program? Why?
Field experiences (internship and practicum) were highlighted in the responses to the
first question (over 75% of students mentioned this). Students appreciated the
opportunity to apply their classroom learning. Several students mentioned the support
and guidance they received and how much they learned about themselves. Some
specific courses/experiences were mentioned by individual students, such as the
addiction courses, administration of human services, and student presentations.

2.​ What did you feel was the least worthwhile part of this program? Why?
16

4%

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

Many students indicated that there was no part of the program that was not
worthwhile. Five students noted that the textbook for practicum was redundant and
could have been used in the internship. A few students felt that the demands were
overwhelming, particularly the practicum hours, while others indicated that the
internship had too few hours to be effective. Individual students mentioned specific
courses and experiences (statistics, focused electives/budgeting class, the portfolio,
and too much group work).
3.​ Suggestions for improving the program:
Only a few seniors offered suggestions for improving the program, but one theme
was the expansion of course offerings and tracks. Suggestions included: more
counseling classes, therapeutic play, disabilities, trauma and more psychology
courses. One student suggested that University Supervisors visit sites more often and
early in the semester to catch problems early. Another student requested more
graduate school articulations.

●​ No: 13% (3 students)
Summary of Results for Agency Evaluation
A majority of students (87%) indicated that they would recommend their placement to
another student. Four students (13%) would not recommend their placement to another
student. The CHS chair and the field placement coordinator have examined specific issues
and visited one site. For those sites that may not be beneficial to all students, placements
will be made selectively.
Seniors listed a wide variety of duties at their placements. They observed and assisted
supervisors, and planned, implemented, and assessed activities. Many reported that they
were responsible for general “office work” such as data entry and filing. Other duties
included intake and outreach and communication with clients, employees within the
organization, and the public.
Students listed many qualities that are necessary for success in the placements. Adaptability
(flexibility), willingness to learn, and patience were noted in most responses. Other traits
include empathy, ability to work independently, and good communication skills (including
listening skills).
Seniors commented on the challenges they met in the final field experience. These included
slow periods when there wasn’t much to do and a variety of job stresses.
Most students noted the support they received from staff at their sites and from their
University Supervisors. In general, students described the experience as challenging and
rewarding.

Student Field Placement Evaluations
Graduating Students

Summary of Results for Student Field Placement Evaluation
The final Student Field Placement Evaluations in CHS 440 Practicum in Human Services were
used to assess student performance on all 6 program outcomes, which were directly rated by the
students’ field supervisors. The goals were broken down into specific behaviors that supervisors
rated as ‘Below’ ‘Meets’ or ‘Exceeds’ Expectations. Supervisors could make optional comments
on each item and gave overall comments at the end of each evaluation. As background, for this
course students are working at area agencies for either 410 hours or 540 hours over the semester
(about 29 hrs/week or 39 hrs/week). Students work with the Field Placement Coordinator, Dr.
Finkenberg, to select theirs sites; they report weekly to University Supervisors who oversee their
progress is placements; but it is their supervisors at the agencies who complete the evaluations.
Evaluations for all graduates (35 students combined in fall of 2016 and spring of 2017) were
reviewed by both the Department Chair (John Rosicky) and the Field Experience Coordinator
(Mayaugust Finkenberg). The percentage of students who meet or exceed each item was
calculated. Comments were reviewed and shared with faculty, but were not included in the
analysis.
All students either met or exceeded expectations for each of the six goals rated on the Student
Field Placement Evaluation /survey. The field instructors’ comments were positive and
supportive. Students were commended for their professionalism, dedication, enthusiasm and
persistence. Many students demonstrated openness to feedback and constructive criticism and a
willingness to learn. In general students exhibited a high degree of caring for the people they
were working with and their efforts were appreciated by clients and staff.

These data indicate that all students in their senior practicum were rated by their supervisors as
meeting or exceeding expectations on all of the learning outcomes. Nine of the supervisors gave
the student they rated all “exceeds” ratings. In general, about twice as many students were given
“exceeds” ratings as “meets”, but there was some variation on individual items. Items II.C.,
III.B. and III.D. were meant to be yes/no ratings, so the “exceeds” option was crossed out, but
raters did not consistently use the “meets” option on these items; those who did respond used the
24

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

“meets” option, so those items were 100% “meets”. Items III.H. on speaking and writing
professionally and VI.A. on applying key concepts were close to 50/50 “meets”/”exceeds”,
indicating that students did slightly less well on these skills. A professional writing course was
added to the curriculum as a required course in 2014. Still, their performance was strong with no
students being rated as below expectations. One student was given a “Below” expectations rating
on punctuality, but still met expectations on Goal III. One student was identified as struggling
with punctuality.
We will continue to emphasize professionalism in all program courses and settings. In the future,
this may not be the best instrument to assess student attainment of goals. We plan to examine
student professional portfolios, which are developed in their seminar course, as well as an
assignment from the capstone clinical skills course (CHS 430 Family Dynamics and
Interventions). This will hopefully give us better data to distinguish areas of difficulty for
students.

In 2018, professional portfolios of seniors were analyzed.
Program outcomes assessed:
2.​ Based on comprehensive self-evaluation and feedback from faculty and supervisors,
develop individualized professional development goals and objectives.
3.​ Exhibit consistent professional attitudes and behaviors in applied human services
settings.
6.​ Synthesize and appropriately apply key concepts, methods and values in human services
to professional situations, independently and with minimal supervision.
Methodology:
Professional portfolios were collected from one of the two CHS 441 Seminar in Human Services
courses that graduating seniors complete in conjunction with their practicum experience in their
last semester. A total of 10 portfolios were examined (59% of graduating students). Each
portfolio was rated independently by two faculty members on each of the three outcomes, using
the attached rubric and a 3-points scale. Ratings were: Inadequate/No Evidence (0),
Adequate/Satisfactory (1), and Excellent (2). Raters gave the same ratings on 83% of the items.
When ratings were different, they were averaged together.
Data Summary:
The average scores on each outcome are listed below. On all measures, half or more artifacts
were rated as adequate. An addition 30-40% were rated as excellent. Three artifacts were rated as
inadequate by at least one rater (one for professional development goals and two for professional
attitudes and behaviors).

Identify which areas show the greatest difficulties with learning and which show the least:
The application of key concepts, methods and values (Objective #6) was most evident in these
artifacts. All artifacts were rated as adequate or excellent by both faculty raters.
The demonstration of professional attitudes and behaviors (Objective #3) was rated based on
professionalism of writing and presentation. Two artifacts were judged to be inadequate by at
least one of the raters. While 80% or artifacts were rated as adequate or excellent, there was less
consistency on this objective then on others.
Use of Results (to impact course, program, assessment process, etc.):
Students continue to struggle with consistently demonstrating professionalism in their writing
and electronic communications. While most of them are able to maintain an acceptable degree of
professionalism, this is an area that we will continue to emphasize. A new course was recently
created (CHS 217 Professional Development in Counseling & Human Services) that will stress
the importance of professionalism. We also continue to offer writing-intensive courses that
require students to practice good writing skills.

STEVENSON
U N I V E R S I T Y
Dear Student,
By choosing to major in Counseling & Human Services you have indicated that you want to
be in a profession that focuses on helping individuals overcome problems in order to live
fuller, more productive, lives. We have carefully structured the courses you will take and the
field placements you will experience to ensure that when you graduate you will be well
equipped to assume a position in human services. You will be eligible, upon graduation, to
obtain your professional credential as a Human Services – Board Certified Practitioner
(HS-BCP). In addition, you will be well prepared to continue your education in graduate
programs such as guidance and counseling, social work, human services, marriage and family
therapy, and counseling.
We believe that you will find the process of attaining these outcomes to be intellectually
stimulating and enjoyable, thanks largely to a dedicated team of faculty members who
combine academic excellence, professional experience in the field, and an enthusiasm for
teaching. Most importantly, however, every faculty member in Counseling & Human
Services is sincerely interested in each student as an individual. We demonstrate this caring
both in the classroom and outside of the classroom.
We hope that this handbook will act as an introduction to the department and will answer
many of the questions you might have. You are responsible for the information contained in
the handbook, including understanding and adhering to the Ethical Standards of Human
Services Professionals described in Appendix B, so please read it carefully and refer to it as
you progress through the department.
All of us in the Counseling& Human Services Department look forward to working with you!
Sincerely,

John Rosicky
John Rosicky, Ph.D.

MISSION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNSELING & HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT

Mission
The mission of the Counseling & Human Services Department is to provide students with an
educational foundation that will prepare them for meaningful and effective careers within the
human services field and successful continuation of their education.
Purpose
The Counseling & Human Services Department prepares students to become effective
professionals in the helping disciplines. The program focuses on skill development, problem
solving, and the application of research and best practice principles. Students learn to help
others and to prepare thoughtfully and systematically for their careers. To meet these
commitments, the Counseling & Human Services Department offers its students a broad
curriculum, learning experiences and professional activities beyond the classroom, and high
levels of student-faculty interaction and collaboration.
The Counseling & Human Services program is designed to give students a comprehensive
understanding of how individuals and families develop and function. Students also acquire
the skills necessary to provide services to individuals and families. Therefore, the
coursework, in addition to courses that fulfill the University’s requirements, is composed of
(1) courses that emphasize the development and functioning of individuals and families, (2)
courses that focus on the skills required to help individuals and families, and (3) field work.
The curriculum incorporates theory, research, and application, with field experience as a
crucial part of the courses. In addition to the required courses, students choose five focused
electives that allow them to tailor their program to meet their individual needs and interests.
These electives are courses that have been approved by faculty members in the department as
being relevant to a career in human services, but are not specific requirements.
Students may pursue a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts degree in Counseling &
Human Services. The Bachelor of Arts degree requires the completion of at least two courses
in a foreign language at the intermediate level or above.
DEPARTMENT ACCREDITATION
The Counseling & Human Services Department is nationally accredited by the Council for
Standards in Human Service Education. By achieving accreditation, the Department has
been nationally recognized as a program whose competence warrants public and professional
confidence.
