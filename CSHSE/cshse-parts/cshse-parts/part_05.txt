COUNSELING & HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT
Advisory Board Minutes
February 15, 2019
8:30 – 10:00
MEMBERS PRESENT: Loretta Elizalde, Tom Flis, Arthur Hill, Lauren Minnich, Human
Services Club Representative (Alyssa Livesay), Mayaugust Finkenberg, Tom Swisher, Lauri
Weiner, and John Rosicky.
Introductions: All members introduced themselves and their roles at their places of
employment.
Welcome: Dr. Cheryl Wilson extended her welcome and thanks to the board members for
their participation and talked about the departmental move to the Owings Mills campus.
Approval of Minutes: Minutes from the September meeting were reviewed and approved.
Human Services Club: Club representative, Alyssa Livesay, reported on the club’s activities
and plans. The club hosted a week of events in the fall sponsored by the National Alliance on
Mental Illness (NAMI). They also participated in a “Senior Prom” at Brightview and raised
$210 for the Out of Darkness Walk in the Inner Harbor. During finals week they hosted an
arts and crafts night. The club collected donations for Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital.
They will do another arts and crafts night in the spring plan to participate in a “Walk for
Wishes” event. This semester the club plans to decorate and distribute “Together we Rise”
duffle bags to children in foster care. An education session on domestic violence is planned
in association with the House of Ruth. The club is working to bring in more members and
increase participation.
Dr. Wilson mentioned grant money that is available to support club activities that incorporate
art. John mentioned the “stress bottles” that the club created, along with the First Year
Seminar group, during Mustangs Make a Difference Day. Tom Flis from Sheppard Pratt
volunteered to speak at any club activities about internship opportunities. A suggestion was
made about partnering with other clubs for activities.
Field Experiences Summary: Mayaugust Finkenberg reported on field placements this
semester. Currently, 28 students are in internships and 17 students are in practicum
placements. There are no new placements for practicum students this semester, but a new site
near campus is working with an intern: Maximum Day Services, a medical day treatment and
substance abuse program. Six students are at Sheppard Pratt, four are at St. Vincent’s and
three are at St. Elizabeth School.

Department Overview
Department Move: The department has successfully transitioned to the Owings Mills North
campus and all were welcomed to our new home. Having classes on this campus has already
helped with enrollments and we are looking forward to continued growth. We continue to
work on making our space more welcoming. Loretta suggested signage to help people find
the offices.
Program Revisions: The name of the department has been changed to Counseling & Human
Services. Course designators will be changed to CHS starting this fall. Mayaugust described
how the new Trauma and Crisis Intervention course is going and said that students were
enthusiastic, including several criminal justice majors who add a different perspective on
crisis. This course will be offered every other spring semester. Next spring Tom will be
teaching another new course on coping, resilience and growth-focused counseling. He spoke
about plans for that course. Mayaugust will be teaching Professional Development in
Counseling & Human Services for the first time in the fall. This course will include a
speakers series about career opportunities and the development of professional portfolios.
We talked about moving to the use of ePortfolios. Several free options are available.
Members of the board thought that was a good idea and mentioned that other schools,
including Johns Hopkins, are using them. Arthur will send contact information on someone
who is using them. Blackboard was suggested as a possible resource, as well as asking other
chairs and contacting career services at SU.
January Term Trips: John described his January term trip to Ecuador with students, which
was successful. We hope to continue offering these experiences.
Reaccreditation: This semester, John will be working on writing a self-report on the status of
the department for CSHSE reaccreditation. The board may need to provide supporting
information.
Enrollment Statistics: Statistics on student enrollment continue to show a downward trend
(see attached chart). This spring we have a total of 78 majors and 20 minors. We need to
make continuing efforts to recruit students and emphasize the unique strengths of the
Counseling & Human Services program through marketing and publicity efforts. The name
change and move to the OM campus should be helpful in that regard.
Advisory Board Input:
Loretta announced that she can take students seeking field experience now that she has
moved into a new location in Pikesville. She is developing a number of groups, including
men’s and women’s groups, LGBT, couples, families and first responders. Lauren said that
the Target program is very happy with SU students who are working there, including Chris
and Abbey. Sheppard Pratt has a total of 15 interns and almost half of them are from
Stevenson. A trauma unit at SP is something that students from the Trauma and Crisis
Intervention class may be interested in exploring. Arthur mentioned that Project Search, near
3

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

Johns Hopkins, is a program that seeks to place individuals with disabilities. There may be
internship opportunities there – Arthur will send contact information to Mayaugust.
Upcoming Events:
●​ All are invited to the senior poster session on May 6 at 5:30 in the Rockland Banquet
Room on the Owings Mills campus.
●​ An honors induction ceremony will take place in April (details to follow).
●​ A panel of our alumni and representatives from a couple of graduate schools will be
speaking with our current practicum students on Feb. 25 at 6:00
NEXT MEETING: Friday, September 20, 2019 at 8:30 in MAC N120 on OMN campus.

MEMBERS PRESENT: Lisa Boone, Debbie Boyce, Candice Edwards, Loretta Elizalde,
Tom Flis, Arthur Hill, Erika Rue, Kathea Smith, Human Services Club President (Nicole
Rogers), Mayaugust Finkenberg, Lauri Weiner, and John Rosicky.
Welcome: Dr. Cheryl Wilson was not able to attend, but extended her welcome and thanks

Introductions: All members introduced themselves and their roles at their places of
employment.

club’s activities and plans for future events. Events include a “Senior Prom” and recreation
evening at Brightview, a weeklong series of NAMI events, serving meals at Hopkins House,
and sponsoring several guest speakers. Club officers are now primarily from the major, but
there is a continuing need to increase membership and participation in the club.

Field Experiences Summary: Mayaugust Finkenberg reported on field placements this
semester. Currently, a small group of 7 students are completing their practicum placements
and will graduate in December. Sites where students are working include: Irvine Nature
Center, Target Community Services, Urban Alliance, the Shaffer Center, Gilchrist Hospice,
Baltimore County Public Schools and the SU Office for Student Success.
Department Overview
Department Move to Owings Mills: The department will be moving from the Greenspring
campus to the Owings Mills North campus in January. Our offices will be located on a
hallway near the Center for Environmental Stewardship and the Sarah Manning Greenhouse.
Program Revisions: A new professional development course has been created and will be
offered in place of our professional writing class. Some of the writing projects related to
careers (resume, cover letter, portfolio) will be moved to this class. Other writing
assignments (literature review, needs assessment, grant proposal narrative) will be
incorporated into the research methods course, which will be become a writing intensive
course.
CHS 270 Psychopharmacology and Addiction will now be a required course and PSY 215
Psychopathology will become a focused elective (required in the Addictions and Mental
Health track).
Two new electives that were created based partly on student interest expressed in a survey,
will be offered in coming semesters: Trauma & Crisis Intervention and Coping, Resilience &
Positive Psychology. Mayaugust is working on and will teach the former. Tom is working on
and will teach the latter.
NOHS Conference: The National Organization for Human Service’s annual conference will
be in Philadelphia this year. Two students have been selected to accompany the department
and present a poster on the incorporation of field experiences into Human Services
programs. The students are: Izzy Ramsland and Annie Lerch.
January Term Trips: This January we will combine with a Service Learning course to run a
trip to Quito, Ecuador that John will lead, along with Rebecca Pisano, head of the service
learning and travel study programs.
Graduate Survey Results: Feedback from graduating seniors last fall was reviewed. Students
consistently point to their field experiences, and to faculty, as the most beneficial parts of the
program. Partly in response to student concerns, the number of hours required for the
practicum will be limited to 410 (9 credit hours). This is already the most common option for
students, but the 12-credit hour (540 hour, 39 hour/week) option will be eliminated.
Enrollment Statistics: Statistics on student enrollment continue to show a downward trend
(see attached chart). This semester we have a total of 83 majors and 16 minors. We need to
make continuing efforts to recruit students and emphasize the unique strengths of the Human
Services program through marketing and publicity efforts. In discussing the enrollment
5

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

statistics, Kathea suggested getting information from the admissions office about students
who are accepted into Stevenson but end up going somewhere else and what schools they
ultimately attend.
Board Input and Suggestions
All members for the advisory board described current events at their places of employment.
Lisa Boone gave an update on community college transfer issues and the status of a 4 year
degree option, which is on hold for now. Recruitment efforts and conversion rates seem to
benefit from personal touches. Arthur Hill reported that Kennedy Krieger has a new CEO
and is seeking interns for their programs. Sheppard Pratt has a new administration and is
offering diverse internship experiences, coordinated by new board member Tom Flis. He
advocated for a focus on BCBA certification, since there is a great need. St. Elizabeth School
is expanding its teaching space into the laundry building, which is being renovated. Debbie
Boyce will be leaving the advisory board, but was thanked for her years of dedicated
commitment to the Human Services program at SU. She brought Erika Rue to the meeting,
who will be replacing her on the advisory board. Candice Edwards described governmental
issues and reported that changes at the federal level have led to noticeable decreases in
funding for TANF and other social welfare programs, as well as an increase in restrictions.
There has been a crackdown on child support for non-custodial parents in the state and an
increase in eligibility for daycare.
Upcoming Events: All are invited to the senior poster session on December 3 at 5:30 in the
Pavilion on the Greenspring campus.
NEXT MEETING: Friday, February 15, 2019 at 8:30 on the Owings Mills campus

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

MEMBERS PRESENT: Lisa Boone, Debbie Boyce, Bunny Ebling, Candice Edwards,
Loretta Elizalde, Arthur Hill, Lauren Minnich, Kathea Smith (by phone), Human Services
Club President (Nigel Moore), Mayaugust Finkenberg, Tom Swisher, Lauri Weiner, and John
Rosicky.
Welcome: Dr. Cheryl Wilson was not able to attend, but extended her welcome and thanks
to the board members for their participation.
Approval of Minutes: Minutes from the September meeting were reviewed and approved.
Introductions: All members introduced themselves and their roles at their places of
employment.
Human Services Club: Club representative, Nigel Moore (President), reported on the club’s
activities from the Fall semester, which included the “Senior Prom” at Brightview, a
weeklong series of NAMI events, serving meals at Hopkins House in November, and making
PBJ and hygiene bags to distributed in Baltimore. This spring the club has planned an Earth
Day event, will return to Brightview for a recreation evening (possibly bingo), will read to
kids, sponsor several guest speakers, and participate in the Super Hero walk for Maryland.
Nigel expressed a desire to expand club membership and get more Human Services majors
involved (most active members are in nursing and biochemistry and most are juniors and
seniors). There is a need to increase membership and participation in the club.
Field Experiences Summary: Mayaugust Finkenberg reported on field placements this
semester. Currently, 21 students are in internships and 17 students are in practicum
placements. Sites where students are working include: Project Youth and JHU, Senior
Housing at Sunrise Assisted Living in Columbia, Turn Around – an agency dealing with
human trafficking, International Social Services (this placement has been affected by the
metro closure), House of Ruth, Mentoring Mentors (a program founded and run by alumnus
Alphonso Mayo), and programs dealing with domestic violence and teen pregnancy. We are
anticipating 9 students in practicum next fall.
Department Overview
Department Name Change: The program name change to “Counseling and Human Services”
has been approved and will become official over the summer. It is hoped that the change will
help with recruiting students.
Graduate Survey Results: Feedback from graduating seniors last spring was reviewed.
Students consistently point to their field experiences, and to faculty, as the most beneficial
parts of the program. Partly in response to student concerns, the number of hours required for
the practicum will be limited to 410 (9 credit hours). This is already the most common option
for students, but the 12-credit hour (540 hour, 39 hour/week) option will be eliminated.
Program Modifications: In response to student feedback and a departmental faculty retreat in
December, we are proposing several program modifications and board input was solicited. In
7

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

addition to reducing the practicum hours, we have changed the name of the addictions course
to Psychopharmacology and Addictions and will be requiring it of all majors. The name of
CHS 315 has been changed to Group Counseling (from Group Processes and Practices). We
polled our current students on which topics classes they would be most interested in taking.
The results are attached and were reviewed in the meeting. We discussed potential topics and
advisory board members shared a number of helpful ideas. Related to the low interest
expressed by students in classes on aging, Lisa Boone indicated that at CCBC a certificate in
Elder Care runs because it is offered online and attracts a number of returning students who
are currently working. A course in Crisis Intervention, including anger de-escalation, conflict
resolution, mediation skills, and burnout issues, was strongly endorsed, with Arthur Hill
noting that Kennedy Krieger has employees take Crisis Prevention and Intervention (CPI)
training. Candice Edwards suggested that a course related to immigrants, homeless and
diverse populations, including at least 5 hours of out-of-class experience, would be useful for
students. Some of this is currently covered in the required CHS 220 Diversity and Cultural
Competence. The growing importance of Applied Behavioral Analysis and the BCBA
certification in the field was stressed. This material is included in current counseling courses,
but could be developed into a separate course.
Other program modifications we discussed were:
●​ Requiring that at least one focused elective be an CHS course (this idea was endorsed
by the board);
●​ Moving a majority of the professional writing requirement into the Research
Methods course (all agreed that writing was an important skill that needs to be
retained in the program) and revamping the current professional writing course into a
sophomore Career Seminar, which could offer an opportunity for outside speakers
from local agencies and graduate programs (Bunny Ebling asked about our
connection to the MSW program at UMB and stressed the importance of students
knowing about the MSW degree);
●​ Requiring a course on Psychopharmacology and Addictions (the course is currently
a focused elective in the Addictions track);
●​ Removing the required LAW 259 Child and Family Law course; much of that
material will be covered in CHS 275 Services for Children and Youth and the CHS
201 Intro to Human Services will incorporate more material on legal and social
policy issues;
●​ Move PSY 215 Psychopathology into the Addiction & Mental Health track, so it is
no longer a required course for all majors.
January Term Trips: The trip that Lauri Weiner had organized to Arizona in January to
engage in social service projects on the Navaho Nation did not get enough students to run.
We will continue to offer opportunities for international social work in the Winterim. Next
January we will probably combine with the Service Learning office to run a trip to Quito,
Ecuador. Mayaugust has raised the possibility of a trip to Indonesia the following year.
Enrollment Statistics: Statistics on student enrollment continue to show a downward trend
(see attached chart). This spring we have a total of 83 majors and 20 minors. We need to
8

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

make continuing efforts to recruit students and emphasize the unique strengths of the Human
Services program through marketing and publicity efforts.
Upcoming Events: All are invited to the Honors Induction ceremony on April 11 at 6:00 and
to the senior poster session on April 30 at 5:30, both events are in the Pavilion on the
Greenspring campus.

8:30 – 10:00
MEMBERS PRESENT: Ted McCadden (for Lisa Boone), Debbie Boyce, Bunny Ebling,
Loretta Elizalde, Arthur Hill, Lauren Minnich, Human Services Club President (Nigel
Moore), Kathea Smith, Mayaugust Finkenberg, Tom Swisher, Lauri Weiner, and John
Rosicky.
Welcome: Dr. Cheryl Wilson, Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, welcomed the
advisory board and thanked the board for their participation.
Introductions: All members introduced themselves and their roles at their places of
employment.
Approval of Minutes: Minutes from the February meeting were reviewed.
Human Services Club: Club representative, Nigel Moore (President), reported on the club’s
upcoming activities, which include the “Senior Prom” at Brightview and serving meals at
Hopkins House in November. Nigel expressed a desire to expand club membership,
particularly within the Human Services department and to develop a transition plan for after
9

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

he graduates in May. The club maintains a Facebook page and website where photos of their
activities can be posted.
Field Experiences Summary: Mayaugust Finkenberg reported on field placements this
semester. Currently, 12 students are in practicum placements in a variety of placement sites,
including the Baltimore Child Abuse Center, Kennedy Krieger, St. Elizabeth School, Mtn.
Manor, Sheppard Pratt, and the Y of Central Maryland. We are anticipating 20 students in
practicum next semester and 22 in internship. Mayaugust is currently working with students
to find placements and already has three confirmed. New sites being developed include
Project Youth at Johns Hopkins, Turn Around (a program dealing with human trafficking),
and International Social Services. Ted described the field placements at CCBC related to
addiction counseling.
Department Overview
Department Name Change: A proposal to change the name of the program to “Counseling
and Human Services” has been submitted to MHEC. We are awaiting approval. This change
should help us to recruit students into the program. The general consensus at the meeting
was that this would be a positive change. It will be important for the program to be clear in
all materials that students will NOT become licensed counselors once they complete the
program.
Program Move to Owings Mills: It is likely that academic programs will be moving from the
Greenspring campus to the Owings Mills campus in the next couple of years. This is in order
to consolidate programs at the OM campus, so students do not have to travel between
campuses, and to take advantage of recent expansion on the OM campus. Several people
expressed sadness at possibly leaving the lovely Greenspring campus. It currently looks like
this would not happen until at least next summer.
NOHS Conference: Department faculty will be attending the National Organization for
Human Services conference in Des Moines on Oct. 18-21. Two students, Elizabeth Brown
and Rebecca Rohe, will accompany the department and present a poster at the conference.
January Term Trip: Lauri Weiner will be leading a group of students to Arizona in January to
engage in social service projects on the Navaho Nation, if she gets enough students to run the
trip.
Articulation Agreements: Agreements with CCBC and AACC have been updated and
signed. We will continue to pursue partnerships and welcome students from community
colleges to campus.
Graduate Survey Results: Feedback from graduating seniors last spring were reviewed.
Students consistently point to their field experiences, and to faculty, as the most beneficial
parts of the program. However, some concern was expressed by students about the difficulty
of completing the number of hours required and not getting paid. We discussed the
possibility of reducing the number of required hours, but there was also a commitment to
10

Self-Study Stevenson University: Baccalaureate Degree

maintaining this vital part of the program. It will continue to be important to help students
navigate finding a balance between work and practicum.
Enrollment Statistics: Statistics on student enrollment continue to show a downward trend
(see attached chart). This fall we have a total of 87 majors and 20 minors. We need to make
continuing efforts to recruit students and emphasize the unique strengths of the Human
Services program through marketing and publicity efforts. Kathea Smith offered to help by
calling accepted students when the time is appropriate. She also suggested getting
