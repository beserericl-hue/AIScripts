reader to the appropriate syllabus/syllabi and/or specific assignments for verification.
Table of Contents
a.

The historical roots of human services as a discipline and profession.
Response: The historic roots of human services are covered in CHS 105 Human Services and
Social Policy through in-class activities, discussion, lecture, and assigned reading (see Course
Schedule; week 2 is devoted to the history of human services).
In CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing, students read social science research articles that
influenced the development of the human services field and create a detailed research proposal
as a class assignment.
In CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions, students examine a variety of approaches to
family therapy that have historically been utilized. Working in groups, they analyze each model
and report to the class (see the course schedule and description of the group project).
In the Field Placement courses, CHS 380 Internship includes in-class discussion following a
journal assignment that requires students to become familiar with the historic roots of the
agency at which they are completing their particular internships. Similarly, students in CHS 440
Practicum, learn about the history of the agency where they are completing their practicum and
incorporate that into their poster presentations for CHS 441 Seminar at the end of the semester.

b.

Historical and current legislation affecting services delivery.
Response: Historical and current legislation affecting services delivery is addressed in CHS 101
Family Studies through discussion, media presentation, lecture, and assigned reading
specifically regarding family structure and the legislation that affects it. This issue is addressed
briefly in most chapters, but see specifically 3/28 “Issues in Contemporary U.S. Families” and
4/4 “Economy and Family Life” in the course schedule.
CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy addresses this issue through reading, lecture, and
discussion, particularly in Week 2, which includes coverage of Great Society programs, welfare
reform and related topics.

​

​

​

Page 65 of 511

CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing includes an exploration of research studies assessing
the need for services and the effectiveness of interventions, which influence legislation. This is
addressed through lecture, discussion, and assigned reading.
CHS 340 Administration of Human Services covers legislation that affects service delivery
indirectly through its influence on how agencies are administered and managed. For example, a
unit on hiring includes legal issues governing this process (see course schedule) and a unit and
assigned project on seeking resources (Course Requirement #6) covers legislation regarding
fund-raising and finances (course schedule).
CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions examines legislation affecting service delivery
through a group project where student groups analyze in-depth different models of family
therapy, both current and historical. The analysis includes legislative issues affecting each
approach (see the Group Project assignment for detail and a list of the models covered).
Legislation affecting service delivery is also addressed in the field placement courses CHS 380
Internship, CHS 440 Practicum and CHS 441 Seminar in that students become familiar with the
legislative issues affecting their particular agency. This is often a topic in the Issues Presentation
project and is included in Poster Presentations about the agencies at which students complete
their practicums.
c.

​

How public and private attitudes influence legislation and the interpretation of policies related to
human services.
Response: There is an emphasis on how public and private attitudes influence legislation and
the interpretation of policies related to human services in CHS 101 Family Studies throughout
the course as the factors influencing various aspects of family are explored through discussion,
media presentation, lecture, and assigned reading. For example, the interpretation of laws
related to same-sex couples, divorce and remarriage and work and family life are considered.
The issue is addressed most directly and deeply in the unit on “Issues in Contemporary U.S.
Families” (see course schedule).
CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy addresses this issue through reading, lecture, and
discussion, particularly in the units on macro-level practice and social policy issues, which
include detailed discussion of public attitudes towards helping(see course schedule).
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing includes discussions about how research on social
issues is influenced by public and private attitudes and legislation (see week 2 in course
schedule). This is addressed through lecture, discussion, and assigned reading.
CHS 340 Administration of Human Services covers the influence of public and private attitudes
on legislation and policy through a variety of administrative issues. For example, see the unit on
“Working with a Board” in course schedule.
CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions examines the influence of public and private
attitudes on legislation and policy through a group project where student groups analyze
in-depth different models of family therapy, both current and historical. The analysis includes
legislative issues affecting each approach (see the Group Project assignment for detail and a list
of the models covered).
This issue is also addressed in the field placement courses CHS 380 Internship, CHS 440
Practicum and CHS 441 Seminar in that students become familiar with the legislation and
interpretation of policies that affects their particular agency. This is often a topic in the Issues
Presentation project and is included in Poster Presentations about the agencies at which students
complete their practicums.

The broader sociopolitical issues that affect human service systems.
Response: Sociopolitical issues, including systems of governance and economics, are addressed
in CHS 101 Family Studies, particularly as they relate to family issues through historical,
national, and cultural contexts. Learning is accomplished through in-class activities, discussions,
media presentations, lectures, and assigned readings.
Sociopolitical issues are also integrated throughout CHS 105 Human Services and Social
Policy, particularly as they relate to the emergence of human services systems and the unit on
Social Policy and Intervention (see course schedule).
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing includes discussions about how research on social
issues is influenced by government and economic systems (see week 2 in course schedule).
This is addressed through lecture, discussion, and assigned reading.
CHS 340 Administration of Human Services covers the influence of government and economic
policies on a variety of administrative issues. For example, a unit on hiring includes legal issues
governing this process (see course schedule) and a unit and assigned project on seeking
resources (Course Requirement #6) covers both governmental (grants) and economic issues
(course schedule).
Government and economic systems and their relationship to family dynamics are covered in
CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions through a group project where student groups
analyze different models of family therapy. The analysis includes how each approach fits within
government and economic systems (see the Group Project assignment for detail and a list of the
models covered).
Differences between systems of governance and economics is also addressed in the field
placement courses CHS 380 Internship, CHS 440 Practicum and CHS 441 Seminar in that
students become familiar with the governmental and economic issues affecting their particular
agency. These issues are often a topic in the Issues Presentation project and are included in
Poster Presentations about the agencies at which students complete their practicums.
Required non-major course SOC 101 Introduction to Sociology includes frequent consideration
of governmental and economic issues related to sociology.

e.

​

Exposure to a spectrum of political ideologies.
Response: Exposure to a spectrum of political ideologies occurs in each unit of CHS 101
Family Studies , but see particularly “Selecting a Partner”, “Diversity in Marriages and
Familes”, and “Employment in Relationships” where different political perspectives on family
policy are studied directly.
In CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy, political ideologies are central to discussions of
the historical roots of helping and social policy and intervention approaches, as well as many
other units, which are covered through in-class activities, discussions, media presentations,
lectures, assigned readings, and out-of-class assignments. See especially the assignment “Issue
Presentation and Report”.
In addition, political ideologies and their influence on research are discussed in CHS 224
Research Methods and Writing. See particularly week 2 in course schedule on the foundations
of social science research.
Political ideologies and their relationship to family dynamics are covered in detail in CHS 430
Family Dynamics and Interventions through a group project where student groups analyze
different models of family therapy. The analysis includes how each approach fits with different

​

political ideologies (see the Group Project assignment for detail and a list of the models
covered).
Exposure to a spectrum of political ideologies also occurs in the field placement courses CHS
380 Internship, CHS 440 Practicum and CHS 441 Seminar in that students become familiar with
political ideologies that affect their particular agency. These issues are often a topic in the Issues
Presentation project and are included in Poster Presentations about the agencies at which
students complete their practicums.
Political ideologies, as they relate to the specific topics of the courses, are analyzed throughout
the required non-major course SOC 101 Introduction to Sociology and covered tangentially in
PSY 101 Introduction to Psychology.
f.

Skills to analyze and interpret historical data for application in advocacy and social change.
Response: Coverage of skills to analyze and interpret historical data for application in advocacy
and social change is accomplished through in-class activities, discussion, lecture, and assigned
reading, in CHS 101 Family Studies. In this course, students learn about the historical and social
roots of each topic addressed and consider ways that current conditions could be changed to
benefit families (see particularly “Marriage Relationships,” “Same-Sex Couples” and “Family
Social Policy”).
In CHS 105 Human Services and Social Policy, the historical roots of helping are examined and
the notion of advocacy is introduced through the helping process and through social policy and
intervention. See especially the assignment “Issue Presentation and Report.”
CHS 224 Research Methods and Writing is fundamentally about the application of data to
influence social policy and interventions. See particularly week 2 in course schedule on the
foundations of social science research and the unit on historical/comparative research (week 12).
The central project for the course is that students develop a detailed Research Proposal on a
topic related to human services.
CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions addresses the use of data to support different
types of family therapy interventions through a group project where student groups analyze
in-depth different models of family therapy, both current and historical. The analysis includes
historical data on the effectiveness of each approach (see the Group Project assignment for
detail and a list of the models covered).
Skills to analyze and interpret historical data for application in advocacy and social change are
also developed in the field placement courses CHS 380 Internship, CHS 440 Practicum and
CHS 441 Seminar in that students practice these skills as they relate to their particular agency.

2. Human Systems
Context: The human services professional must have an understanding of the structure and dynamics
of organizations, communities, and society as well as the nature of individuals and groups. This
understanding is prerequisite to the determination of appropriate responses to human needs.

activities, discussions, media presentations, lectures, assigned readings, and out of class
assignments). In both CHS 380 and 430, students participate in an in-class activity involving
the formation of small groups and the subsequent analysis of each group’s dynamic (see Group
Project in CHS 430).
CHS 441 Seminar addresses use of small groups in discussions and is itself a small group. This
course provides an opportunity for students to discuss and learn more about issues related to the
practicum and to the field of human services. Similar in organization to a professional
development meeting, the seminar is designed to help facilitate the transition from
undergraduate school to work and/or graduate school.
2.​ Theories of group dynamics
Response: Theories of group dynamics are introduced in CHS 105 Human Services and Social

An introduction to the organizational structures of communities.
Response:
The organizational structures of communities are introduced in CHS 101 Family Studies,
particularly in the units on Work and Family Life, and Family Social Policy, although the social
structures of communities affect families in all areas.
The organizational structures of communities are also addressed in CHS 105 Human Services
and Social Policy through lectures and discussions, notably in the unit on Social Policy and
Intervention. A community needs assessment was added as a major assignment in the course
following the previous accreditation self-report.
In CHS 430 Family Dynamics and Interventions, the organizational structures of communities
are considered as they relate to family dynamics. See the unit on Family as a Psychosocial
System (9/12). The material is covered through lecture, discussion, readings, reflections and
written assignments.
Field Placement courses CHS 380 Internship, CHS 440 Practicum. and CHS 441 Seminar
require students to understand the organizational structures of the communities within which
they work at their agencies. Each student is evaluated on their ability to “demonstrate
knowledge about the customs, practices, beliefs and values of the cultures and communities
within which he or she practices” (see Student Evaluation Form, Section IV.B)
