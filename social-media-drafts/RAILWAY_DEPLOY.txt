4. Railway will auto-detect Next.js and configure the build

5. Add Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard:
   - Click on your service → "Variables" tab
   - Add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = your-anthropic-api-key-here
   - (Optional) Add: OPENAI_API_KEY = your-openai-key-here

6. Click "Deploy" - Railway will build and deploy automatically

7. Once deployed, click "Generate Domain" to get your public URL


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
----------------------
Required for AI features:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY    - Your Anthropic API key for Claude AI

Optional:
  OPENAI_API_KEY       - Your OpenAI API key (fallback)
  NODE_ENV             - Set to "production" (auto-set by Railway)


RAILWAY CLI DEPLOYMENT (Alternative):
-------------------------------------
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway

ESTIMATED COSTS (Railway Pricing):
----------------------------------
- Hobby Plan: $5/month (includes $5 credit)
- Pro Plan: Pay per usage (~$0.000463/GB-min RAM, ~$0.0000231/CPU-min)
- Typical Next.js app: ~$5-15/month depending on traffic


TROUBLESHOOTING:
