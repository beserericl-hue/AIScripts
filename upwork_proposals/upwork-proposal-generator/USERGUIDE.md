## Integration Workflow

### How Proposals Are Generated

The proposal generation process involves multiple systems working together:

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Automatic Job Discovery (GigRadar)
1. GigRadar scans Upwork for new jobs matching your criteria
2. When a job is found, GigRadar sends it to the Upwork Proposal Generator via webhook
3. The job appears in your Pending Jobs list with a "GigRadar" badge

#### Manual Job Entry
1. You can also manually create jobs by navigating to the Proposal page
2. Enter the job details and click "Create Proposal"

#### Proposal Generation
1. Click on a pending job to view its details
2. Click "Create Proposal" to navigate to the Proposal screen
3. Review/edit the job information if needed
4. Select your profile (or create a new one)
5. Click "Create Proposal" button
6. The system:
   - Sends job data to N8N webhook
   - N8N workflow generates cover letter, document, and diagram
   - N8N sends results back via callback webhook
   - UI updates automatically via real-time SSE connection
7. The generated proposal appears in the right column

#### Submission Tracking
1. Copy the cover letter to Upwork
2. Click "Submitted" to update the status
3. When you hear back:
   - Click "Won" if you got the contract
   - Click "Lost" if rejected
   - Click "Can't Bid" if the job is private or unavailable

## Tips and Best Practices

### Profile Management
- Create multiple profiles for different types of work
- Keep profiles under 4000 characters (Upwork limit)
- Use the "Save Profile" button after making changes

### Efficient Workflow
1. Review pending jobs daily
2. Use date filters to focus on recent jobs
3. Use search to find specific job types
4. Reject irrelevant jobs promptly to keep the list clean

### Team Collaboration
- Assign team members to appropriate teams
- Configure callback team in Settings for proper job routing
- Check who created each proposal via the user name display

### Real-Time Updates
- Keep the browser tab open to receive instant updates
- The SSE connection auto-reconnects if interrupted
- No need to manually refresh the page

---

## Troubleshooting

### Proposal Not Appearing
1. Check that N8N webhook URL is configured in Settings
2. Verify N8N workflow is active and running
3. Check the browser console for SSE connection errors
4. Try refreshing the page

### Jobs Not Showing
1. Check your date filter settings (might be filtering out jobs)
2. Clear any search text
3. Verify you're assigned to the correct team

### API Key Issues
1. Ensure the API key is active (toggle in Settings)
2. Verify the key is correctly configured in N8N/GigRadar
3. Generate a new key if the old one is compromised

### Login Problems
1. Verify your email address is correct
2. Check for the verification email in spam folder
3. Request a new verification code if expired (10 minutes)
4. Contact an administrator if locked out
